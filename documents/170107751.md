How to obtain alarm code
------------------------

* You should be S4A employee for +6 months (unless you have a permission to get it earlier from Manager and CIO)
* Please create ticket in Jira in "S4A Internal Helpdesk & Maintenance" project and assign to @Bartłomiej Bujnarowski
* Please wait for @Bartłomiej Bujnarowski to contact you

Once you will be contacted and will receive your code:

In the morning
==============

* To access our office you need to sign in on reception desk and take a key to your floor
* Once on the proper floor open door using key
* Walk in unlocking door by checking in with your entrance card
* Wave your hand in front of alarm's movement sensor, wait 2-3 seconds - it should beep and middle diode on keypad (white keypad) should start to blink in yellow

!!!IMPORTANT!!! If it won't start to blink and beep do not proceed to next step - it means alarm was not armed the day before!!! Report that as a security incident (use Security Incident Reporting Procedure / Procedura zgłaszania incydentów związanych z bezpieczeństwem )

* Enter your code on that white keypad and press # key - that is the way to enable or disable alarm, so e.g. - "123456#"
* Leave a key where it belongs - different place on different floor - ask someone

In the evening
==============

* Check whether you are the last employee that is leaving the floor
* Check again  whether you are the last employee that is leaving the floor
* Find a key
* On white keypad, arm the alarm entering your code and pressing a # key - e.g. "123456#"
* Walk out
* Close door using key
* Sign out on the reception desk and leave a key there

That's it!

Please report all questions and doubts here: [S4AHelpdesk@smart4aviation.aero](mailto:S4AHelpdesk@smart4aviation.aero)

*If you do not have your individual alarm code, it is possible to **arm** alarm using special code **designed only for arming**. Code: **111111** followed by hash (#) button.*

!!!IMPORTANT!!!
===============

In case of alarm activation (don't you worry, you will know once you'll hear it :) ), e.g. due to mistake or some technical difficulties please call immediately one of those guys: @Paweł Kosecki and if not available to @Jakub Zakrzewski

(Write down their phone number from BambooHR and OPTIONALLY but it will be very helpful - send them a short text message that you have added them as your phone contact - they need your number too

e.g. Hi here's Jan Janowski, this is my mobile number. Cheers!).
