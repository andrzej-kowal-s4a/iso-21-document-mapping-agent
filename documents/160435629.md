1. Purpose
==========

Upgrade tickets are to be used in situation we have to perform important change in all implementation projects and support projects. We don't want to miss anyone since the impact might be severe. This procedure describes how to handle upgrade tickets in order to process them as soon as possible.

2. The procedure
================

1. Upgrade ticket can be initiated as a result of internal investigation (e.g. issue found by product team or PO) or problem reported by one customer and needs handling in other projects
2. Upgrade ticket should be reviewed and accepted by @Wojciech Przybylski
3. Issue Owner should review the scope of upgrade ticket and check if:

   1. She/he understands what needs to be done - description and business value
   2. Makes sure "Scope in a project" is properly set. This value will be copied as description to all project tickets so it should be descriptive.
4. Owner executes action "Ready to implement"- issue goes to "ready to implement" status
5. Owner clones it to all projects - issue creates tickets in all projects and goes to status "Waiting for projects"

   1. In case the issue is valid only for few projects Owner can use transition "I will clone to projects manually" to avoid automated cloning, in this case issue should be manually cloned to proper projects

7. At the moment cloned issues will be assigned to person that created upgrade ticket (as requested by AKowal)
8. Owner organizes a meeting or chat/channel and coordinates "execution" in all projects
9. By "execution" we mean:

   1. project issue gets cancelled (e.g. not applicable for given project)
   2. project issue gets closed as implemented
   3. project issue gets scheduled to some release (can be some already planned release or Next.Maintenance.Upgrade or Next.Major.Upgrade )
10. Once all project issues are "executed"/handled upgrade ticket can be closed
