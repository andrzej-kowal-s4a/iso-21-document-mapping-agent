1. Given that:

* CVSS score denotes technical (theoretical) severity i.e. how easily the vulnerability could be exploited and the level of impact (in terms of confidentiality, integrity and availability) if the vulnerability was indeed exploited. It does not quantify actual risk presented by the vulnerability, esp. as only base score is typically used, with relatively few cases where temporal score is provided. This makes CVSS rather static throughout the specific vulnerability's lifecycle; and
* in its Predictive Prioritization process, [Tenable.io](http://Tenable.io) creates or ingests several metrics that describe probability of exploiting the specific vulnerability. This includes existence of the possible exploit code and its maturity, relative number of affected products (which would certainly influence how common is the skill to exploit), how much buzz in the industry was generated by this vulnerability and how recently etc. Those metrics are aggregated into the Tenable's *Vulnerability Priority Rating* (VPR); and
* as the vulnerability findings cannot realistically be remediated all at once, they shall be prioritized based on risk i.e. how likely is appearance of a malicious actor capable of exploiting of the vulnerability and what would be the consequences to confidentiality, integrity and availability of the affected systems,

**the server/network component vulnerability prioritization would be primarily based on the the** [**Tenable.io**](http://Tenable.io)**-provided VPR score.**

2. For issue prioritization, following mapping shall be used:

| **Primary Condition** | **Substitute Condition**  **(when primary condition cannot be evaluated)** | **S4A Jira Ticket Priority** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| VPR range 9.0 to10.0 | CVSSv3 range 9.0 to 10.0 | Critical |
| VPR range 7.0 to 8.9 | CVSSv3 range 7.0 to 8.9 | Major |
| VPR range 4.0 to 6.9 | CVSSv3 range 4.0 to 6.9 | Minor |
| VPR range 0.1 to 3.9 | CVSSv3 range 0 to 3.9 | Trivial |

Please note that for VPR score to be calculated by [Tenable.io](http://Tenable.io), there must be related CVE present in the [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/). In case the VPR score is missing, please resort to prioritizing via CVSSv3 (see table above, column "Substitute Condition".
