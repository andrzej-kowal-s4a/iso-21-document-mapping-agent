### Firewall rules

Smart PORTAL Mobile iOS and Android applications use Firebase ([firebase.google.com/products](http://firebase.google.com/products)) for crash reporting and gathering information about application for better support. In order to have all required information following URLs need to be opened in firewall rules:

1. Application hosts

   1. Smart SUITE host
   2. \*.amazonaws.com - Smart MOBILE MIDDLEWARE available as serverless
2. Google Analytics on port 443:

   * <https://app-measurement.com/a>
3. Firebase Crashlytics on ports 80 and 443:

   * \*.[fabric.io](http://fabric.io/)
   * \*.[crashlytics.com](http://crashlytics.com/)
4. Firebase console on port 443:

   * [console.firebase.google.com](http://console.firebase.google.com/)
5. Google other URLs on port 443:

   * \*.[clients6.google.com](http://clients6.google.com/)
   * \*.[googleapis.com](http://googleapis.com/)
   * [www.gstatic.com](http://www.gstatic.com/)
   * [apis.google.com](http://apis.google.com/)
6. PSPDFkit on port 443 (ACAINT-25048b6fd100-5a64-3d8f-8f9d-41b95d1c8c85System Jira)

   1. <https://pspdfkit-license-service-1.com>
   2. <https://pspdfkit-license-service-2.com>
   3. <https://pspdfkit-license-service-3.com>
   4. <https://pspdfkit-license-service-4.com>
7. Mapbox on port 443:

   1. [\*.mapbox.com](#) including

      1. <https://api.mapbox.com/>
      2. <https://events.mapbox.com/>
      3. <https://config.mapbox.com/>
8. SMTP - Optional, only when customer is using external SMTP to send error and feedback from mobile application. It is a case when customer do no use default Mail client. For configuration details please see deployment guide for example (sample iPad 5.6 - Deployment Guide#UseSMTPaccount)
9. Authentication server - Optional, only when customer is using OIDC for authentication. For configuration details please see deployment guide. (sample iPad 5.6 - Deployment Guide#Configureoauthifneeded)
10. Push notifications - please note that we do not connect directly to Apple services, connection is handled by Operational System (see <https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203609>).

In case of lack of Firebase configuration (points 1 to 4) S4A will have limited information required for support and maintenance of application. This limitation has impact on Service Level Agreement:

* more time required for bug analysis as there is a need to ask a single user for error report form device,
* no possibility to proactively monitor issues reported in Crashlytics and resolve them.

For internal user only (*please do not include in contract*):

* If we do not have Google Firebase (point 1 to 4) application works but we do not have additional logs for investigation.
* Production licence of PSPDFKit (point 5) doesn't require connection to these servers but we need it for non production licences.
