Process flow
============

* As a result of RFC new version of software or non software change needs to be deployed
* Contact (via Jira) proper customer change authority and request Block Time approval providing the change details
* At least one week before BT confirm the approval
* Just before the change - BT approval should be validated during a phone call e.g. with chief dispatcher
* Setup a maintenance page (if needed)
* Perform planned deployment
* Perform smoke tests
* Wait for customer validation results
* Remove a maintenance page (if needed)
* Close BT and update change registry
* Monitor system for few hours, perform post implementation review
