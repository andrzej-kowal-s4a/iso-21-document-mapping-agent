Summary:
========

Service Level Management – the disciplined, proactive methodology and procedures used to ensure that adequate levels of services are delivered to all IT users in accordance with business priorities and at acceptable cost.

 Each SLA/OLA always should be negotiated by an experienced and multidisciplinary team with an equal representation from both the service beneficiary and the service provider. An SLA/OLA is a necessity because a service can only be called "bad" or "good" if this service is clearly described. It formalizes the needs and expectations of the enterprise and serves as such as a kind of "guarantee" for both parties.

OLA negotiations are not zero-sum challenge where service beneficent is going for maximum service levels at minimum cost, whereas service provider negotiator seek to get the deal with minimum effort and comfortable service levels.

Finding a balance between these two position is a vital but very difficult job for solid SLA/OLA and SLM.

Background for a change
=======================

Traditionally, SLAs (service-levels agreements) are used as a method of measuring and potentially penalizing performance according to predetermined, mutually agreed upon standards. Typically, SLAs are between internal and external parties, but we want to use them between departments of an organization. When done correctly, the process of drawing up a formal SLA brings attention to potential issues, identifies objective lessons learned, sets expectations, and increases the likelihood of continual improvements.

As a company we want to manage expectations, boost productivity, and increasing employee morale. It will help us to prioritize work, and as an incentive to provide good service, they lead to better overall system performance. They can also help foster good relations between IT and other departments.

Glossary:

| **Term** | **Description** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Service level agreement (SLA) | An agreement between an IT service provider and a customer. A service level agreement describes the IT service, documents service level targets, and specifies the responsibilities of the IT service provider and the customer. A single agreement may cover multiple IT services or multiple customers | E.g. SLA contract with ACA, ASA, EZY, DAL etc |
| Operational level agreement (OLA) | An agreement between an IT service provider and another part of the same organization. It supports the IT service provider's delivery of IT services to customers and defines the goods or services to be provided and the responsibilities of both parties. For example, there could be an operational level agreement:   * Between the IT service provider and a procurement department to obtain hardware in agreed times * Between the service desk and a support group to provide incident resolution in agreed times. | E.g. contract between project team and product teams |
| Underpinning contract (UC) | A contract between an IT service provider and a third party. The third party provides goods or services that support delivery of an IT service to a customer. The underpinning contract defines targets and responsibilities that are required to meet agreed service level targets in one or more service level agreements | E.g contract with Comarch for hosting services |
