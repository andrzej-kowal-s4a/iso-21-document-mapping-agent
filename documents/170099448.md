### Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to define the limits related to Jira/Confluence accounts for Smart4Aviation customers and clear processes related to periodic checks if a particular user is actively using the account.

### Policy

Rules related to the limit of accounts assigned to particular Customers:

* No ongoing project (steady-state, support mode)

  + 10 accounts for Customers with one domain products (for instance Weight & Balance),
  + 15 accounts for Customers with few domain products (for instance Cabin Crew Briefing and Weight & Balance):
* Ongoing project:

  + 20 accounts for smaller projects
  + 25 accounts for bigger projects (complex multi-product)

As a part of the transition process from Project to Support, the Project Manager should inform the Customer about the limitation and coordinate the reduction of accounts.

If there is a request from the Customer to exceed the above thresholds this should be reported internally in Jira (JIRAADM project, type: Access Request) and assign to the Sales and Marketing Director to:

* decide if we can exceptionally exceed the above limits for free, or
* provide the offer to the Customer for additional accounts.

#### Review and decommissioning of accounts

The accounts for users that are not used the account for more than 3 months (according to the last login date) should be inactivated by Jira Admins with the following communication schema to the particular user:

* four weeks prior to planned inactivation of the account with the information that the account will be de-activated
* one-week prior to planned inactivation of the account with the information that the account will be de-activated
* after de-activating with the information that the account is de-activated

#### Limits

* AAG - 20 (in real ~ 22) → 25 during the HAL project
* CEB - 10
* IBE - 20
* ACA - 35 (they are paying separately for the additional 15 accounts)
* AFR - 15
* QFA - 25
* DAL - 25
* EZY - 25
* MPH - 20
* TVS - 20 during the project, 15 during support
* MEA - 10, 15 during the project
* PAL - 10

From March 2024 we should try charge ~20 EUR/month/user.
