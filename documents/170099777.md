1. In order to receive access to Gerrit create an appropriate ticket in our S4A Jira system under "**S4A Internal Helpdesk & Maintenance**" project with the following parameters:

   1. Issue type - choose "Access Request".
   2. "Summary" field must contain "Gerrit" word, Name and Surname for whom access rights should be granted. Example: Gerrit Pawel Kosecki.
   3. Fill in "Access Path" and "Access Level" (e.g. <https://gerrit.s4a.aero/admin/repos/admins-only/ansible>).
   4. In "Access type (INTHELP)" - choose "Other" option.
   5. Fill in "Acceptor" field - put here your manager that will approve your request.
   6. Fill in Priority.
   7. "Due Date" - be reasonable - access rights will be granted as soon as possible.
   8. Please assign ticket to person listed in the "Acceptor" field and ask for approval.
   9. Acceptance should be recorded e.g. as a comment.
   10. After acceptance ticket should be assigned to @Bartłomiej Bujnarowski or @Paweł Kosecki.
2. If you need to create new project in gerrit please assign tickets to IT Admins member (or to @Jakub Zakrzewski if you have doubts)
3. If you need specific access (list of rights below) please assign tickets to **IT Admins** member **OR** request access inside **Gerrit** (instruction below)

Requesting specified access inside gerrit:
------------------------------------------

1. When you need rights to submit commit changes (+2) or change rights to certain usergroup (e.g. development team) please request for changes inside Gerrit
2. Log in here: [gerrit.s4a.aero](http://gerrit.s4a.aero)
3. Go to: <https://gerrit.s4a.aero/admin/repos> and search for project you need access to

4. Now there are some different paths you request can go:

* You can request for parent access rights change:

You must know exactly what do you need and edit permissions by yourself by clicking"edit"

Put your desired changes below and click "save for review"

* Or just only ad reference for specified catalog:

Click on "edit"

Click "add reference" and put your desired changes. Next click "save for review"

After saving in both ways you have to add Reviewers which should be "Admins Code Review"

You request is now created and you should wait for IT Administrators to accept or decline your request.

Internal note - things to be done in LDAP (administrator work)

1. Add to proper LDAP groups (e.g. developers or testers - should be added during onboarding)  
     
   **cn=Developers,ou=scm,ou=groups,dc=s4a,dc=aero**  
   **cn=Testers,ou=scm,ou=groups,dc=s4a,dc=aero**  
     
   + proper development team  
   **ou=team,ou=scm,ou=groups,dc=s4a,dc=aero**
