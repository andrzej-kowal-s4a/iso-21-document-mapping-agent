S4A google authorization can be used as alternative identity provider. For some environments like test or preprod accounts will be auto-created on first login using dedicated link (see environments and passwords conf page) but for some environments like PROD auto-creation will be turned off and accounts need to be created manually.

How to for account manual creation - auto-creation feature off
==============================================================

Here are the steps needed to create such account:

Prerequisites:

* Account can be created by @Dominik Foltyn , @Paweł Wadas (Unlicensed) or support team member on duty
* User that will create account needs to have user\_management attribute set ( UM2\_user. user\_management = "MANAGE")

Howto:

1. Login to google groups (<https://groups.google.com/my-groups>) and add user to the proper group ( $ICAO$-instancetype-Administrator e.g. IBE-PROD-Administrator or IBE-nonPROD-Administrator)
2. Login to client system using your account, go to Settings-> USER MANAGEMENT
3. Add user with the following configuration:

   1. User ID => Ldap user identifier e.g. s4a00370
   2. Name => Ldap user identifier e.g. s4a00370
   3. LDAP Authentication → disable
   4. SAML Authentication → enable
   5. Airlines Allowed to View → mark all (you can disable VY, 2W, 3P, BA)
   6. Roles will be set automatically to S4A-Administrator during every login (value taken from google configuration). **It means you cannot change Roles from system GUI because it will be replaced during next login.**
4. Ask user to test login

Q/A
===

1. "**No roles assigned for this account in this product**" issue

   2. if user is added to google group - remove his account from application and user should create it once again, that should help

      1. why? Because if user tries to login, even without proper group assignment in google, her/his account will be created. So it might be the case that role update is turned off (very frequent setting) and user will not be able be able to login till it's account is deleted or role S4A\_Admininistator is assigned
   3. ask to check login in incognito mode
   4. check if user is added to proper group in google - if not add him
