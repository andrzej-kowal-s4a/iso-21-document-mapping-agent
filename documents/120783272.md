For CVSS v3 Smart4Aviation uses the following priority rating system:

| **CVSS 3 Severity** | **CVSS 3 Base Score Range** | **S4A Jira** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| None | 0.0 | None |
| Low | 0.1 - 3.9 | Trivial |
| Medium | 4.0 - 6.9 | Minor |
| High | 7.0 - 8.9 | Major |
| Critical | 9.0 - 10.0 | Critical |

Below are a few examples of vulnerabilities that may result in a given priority level.

| **Level** | **Description of examples** |
| --- | --- |
| Critical | Vulnerabilities that score in the critical range usually have most of the following characteristics:   * The exploitation of the vulnerability likely results in root-level compromise of servers or infrastructure devices. * Exploitation is usually straightforward, in the sense that the attacker does not need any special authentication credentials or knowledge about individual victims, and does not need to persuade a target user, for example via social engineering, into performing any special functions. * For critical vulnerabilities, is advised that you patch or upgrade as soon as possible unless you have other mitigating measures in place. For example, a mitigating factor could be if your installation is not accessible from the Internet. |
| High | Vulnerabilities that score in the high range usually have some of the following characteristics:   * The vulnerability is difficult to exploit. * Exploitation could result in elevated privileges. * Exploitation could result in a significant data loss or downtime. |
| Medium | Vulnerabilities that require the attacker to manipulate individual victims via social engineering tactics.   * Denial of service vulnerabilities that are difficult to set up. * Exploits that require an attacker to reside on the same local network as the victim. * Vulnerabilities where exploitation provides only very limited access. * Vulnerabilities that require user privileges for successful exploitation. |
| Low | Vulnerabilities in the low range typically have very little impact on an organization's business.  Exploitation of such vulnerabilities usually requires local or physical system access. |
