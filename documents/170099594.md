=====

This policy applies to:

* all employees and contractors of Smart4Aviation Group, in particular to any person responsible for establishing contractual arrangements with Supplier - legal, procurement and security team, as well as the person responsible for executing Contract i.e. the leader of the project conducted with the participation of the Supplier, including NEED Requestor, and any other person who will work with the Supplier;\\
* all purchases via NEEDS project (detailed handling depending on type of contractual deliverable)

As the Smart4Aviation Group use goods and/or services provided by variety of Suppliers it is the responsibility of Smart4Aviation Group to ensure that purchases are evaluated with regard to security and the risk connected with use of such purchases is assessed and understood.

Rules of Supply Risk Management
===============================

1. Supplier on-boarding - gaining understanding of purchase and sensitivity of related goods and services
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on Purchase Evaluation Form, Security Manager/Legal Team with support of NEED Requestor, if needed, establishes risk level for the required purchase. This process is described in details below.

**1.1 Types of purchases that should be subject to risk analysis**

In order to identify purchases to be analyzed (by Purchase Evaluation Form) below rules shall apply.

The purchase under analysis shall concern the following scope (within the meaning of COMPONENT section completed in Jira NEEDS project):

*"License",*

*"Licenses renewal"*

*"Subscriptions",*

and "*Other*" where "other" can mean e.g. purchase of services, data, membership etc.

Purchases within the following scope (within the meaning of COMPONENT section completed in Jira NEEDS project) are not required for analysis:

*"Anniversary",*

*"Books",*

*"Company Events",*

*"Insurance",*

*"Marketing",*

*"Office furniture",*

*"Office supplies",*

*"Promo events and activities",*

*"Recruitment & EB",*

*"Sport activities",*

*"Team building",*

*"Visa",*

*"Hardware - Existing Employees",*

*"Hardware - Infrastructure"*

Components description can be found here: Jira - Ordering stuff in Jira needs

**1.2 New purchase vs extension/renewal**

Risk analysis shall be completed for each purchase specified in section "Types of purchases that should be subject to analysis".

In the event of the Contract extension/renewal, assessment completed upon first purchase/first verification shall be verified to ensure that nothing has changed, e.g. in case license renewal, service extension.

**1.3 Security Criteria**

Due to every dependency inevitably introducing security risks, it is important to:

* identify purchases/Contracts to be analyzed for its business criticality; and
* assess level of security risk to Smart4Aviation Group, resulting from its business being dependent on the purchases/Contracts' goods and/or services.

In order to assess level of security risk, following security criteria of purchase are to be taken into account:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | **Criteria** |
| 1 | Impact on **business continuity** \*  (what impact will the product/service has on S4A Group if, for example, the product/service becomes unavailable for several hours or days?) |
| 2 | Access to **systems** of S4A Group |
| 3 | Access to other than professional **personal data** / business contact data of S4AGroup employees / contractors  (professional personal data means name, position, phone, e-mail address) |
| 4 | Access to **confidential information** of S4A Group |
| 5 | Access to protected **data of the clients**  (confidential information and/or other than business contact data) |
| 6 | Impact on product and services offered to clients/impact on **clients operations**  (if Supplier failed to complete the Contract, the goods or services  are not in compliance with the Contract) |
| 7 | S4A Group **reputation** impact  (if Supplier failed to complete the Contract, the goods or services  are not in compliance with the Contract) |

* depending on the service level (blocker/critical/major/minor), it might be considered to add the service to the Services Catalog RPO and RTO targets in order to set appropriate RPO and RTO targets.

**1.4 Level of security risk**

In order to identify level of security risk for appropriate purchase, Security Manager/Legal Team with support of NEED Requestor, if needed, shall complete Purchase Evaluation Form.

Based on above-mentioned assessment security risk level of the purchase can be identified as LOW, MEDIUM or HIGH. Notwithstanding the above, the purchase may also be considered high-risk based on Security Manager verification and decision.

If the purchase is classified as high-risk, the following provisions of this policy shall apply.

If the purchase is classified as a medium-risk, section 2.4 shall be taken into consideration i.e. negotiation of the Contract terms, but only in the field of "Confidentiality" and "Personal data protection" requirements set forth in section 2.1 and/or signature of the NDA, DPA.

In the case of high-risk purchase, in order to verify cooperation before it begins, it is recommended for Legal Team to send RFI with security questions in order to obtain a response from the Supplier. Questions shall be customized to the purchase category as set forth in section "Application of appropriate security requirements".

On this basis, Security Manager with the participation of NEED Requestor (if necessary), will decide whether there are any objections to establishing cooperation. This may also serve as the basis for selecting the best Supplier, if more than one is being considered.

If necessary, above mentioned team shall:

* ensure that all questions were answered, if not - ask for completion
* review where "Not Applicable" options were answered, with no convincing explanations provided as comments
* consider where any further clarification would need to be made
* agree next steps with the Supplier e.g. propose, discuss and agree implementation of further controls in order to mitigate risks and propose, discuss and agree timelines where the controls would be implemented - if there is no consensus on corrective actions satisfactory to Smart4Aviation Group section 5 "Supplier Security Risk Management" shall apply.

If for various reasons Supplier does not fill out the form, Smart4Aviation Group (by its Security Manager with NEED Requestor, if necessary) shall complete this form itself based on the available Supplier's terms and conditions, its policies, the knowledge of the people involved in the project etc.

**2.4 Contract Negotiations**

Based on "Application of appropriate security requirements" section,Legal Team verifies if the Contract includes provisions for the appropriate purchase category or similar, if not, Legal Team attempts to negotiate and include these or equivalent provisions in the Contract.

In addition to analyzing/negotiating Contract terms, protection of Information can also be ensured by implementing:

* NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) - agreement shall be signed if any Information will be shared during cooperation with the Supplier and/or Supplier will have access to any of Information and there is no confidential provisions in the Contract, or some Information will be shared before Contract signature

and/or

* DPA (Data Processing Agreement) - agreement shall be signed if Supplier handles Personal Data on behalf of S4A Group.

If the Supplier does not agree to implement the relevant essential contractual provisions, or there are no similar provisions in the Contract and Supplier has not confirmed its commitment to meet the requirements corresponding to such provisions in the RFI or in other documents, e.g., the Supplier's policies available to S4A Group such a commitment to by verified by Legal Team and/or Security Manager depending on the scope, then section 5 "Supplier Security Risk Management" shall apply.

**2.5 Supplier Security Self-Assessment**

This process is described below, in section 3 "Periodic audits of high-risk purchase Suppliers - Supplier Security Self-Assessment ".

**2.6 Security Requirements Review**

Security requirements are to be reviewed and updated at least during the review of this policy, or after any incident.

3. Periodic audits of high-risk purchase Suppliers - Supplier Security Self-Assessment
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Monitoring and evaluation of the Supplier Information security management program, after entering into cooperation, shall take place. Changes in Suppliers Information security practices shall be regularly reviewed and managed by Security Manager and NEED Requestor, if needed.

In case **high-risk purchase** Suppliers, after a specified period of time, e.g. after one year of cooperation (period to be established based on how high the risk is), additional assessment must be performed in order to ensure security capability of Supplier is still in place. The assessment is to be completed by a Supplier (a self-assessment), possibly with assistance of Smart4Aviation Group Security Manager.

Questions in above-mentioned Supplier self-assessment shall be selected as questions in RFI, i.e. in accordance with the provisions of the section 2.2 "Application of appropriate security requirements" - depending on the purchase category.

If for various reasons Supplier does not fill out the form, Smart4Aviation Group (Security Manager with NEED Requestor, if needed) shall complete this form itself based on the available Supplier's terms and conditions, its policies, the knowledge of the people involved in the project etc.

Supplier Security Self-Assessment form shall be compare with the previous one or with RFI.

If discrepancies (risks) arise:

a) the parties should determine the possibility of corrective action

b) if there is no consensus on corrective actions satisfactory to Smart4Aviation Group section 5 "Supplier Security Risk Management" shall apply.

4. Communication of security needs to Suppliers
-----------------------------------------------

Supplier security self-assessment questionnaire (during either RFI phase or self assessment audit) is intended to provide Suppliers of high risk purchase with insight into:

* their responsibility for provision of appropriate protection of the Smart4Aviation Group Information,
* security importance of contracted services or goods they provide to Smart4Aviation Group,
* possible impact on Smart4Aviation Group of failure in contract fulfillment or its disruption.

Any communication to Supplier should contain justification, guidance and be taking account of security and IT maturity of the Supplier. In case audit - e-mail template for Supplier Security Self-Assessment communication may be used.

5. Supplier Security Risk Management
------------------------------------

Where Supplier are considered to be Supplier of high-risk purchase, assurance must be performed to verify that expected security level is implemented in order to alleviate the risk.

Flaws or omissions in the Supplier's security management program, as discovered – before entering into cooperation - based on RFI or after audit - based on Supplier self-assessment (i.e. the requirements met prior to establishing cooperation (RFI) are no longer met), are required to be corrected. In case correction is not possible, and there is outstanding security risk related to this Supplier/Contract:

a) Smart4Aviation Group, if possible, will consider not entering into cooperation with such Supplier or terminate Contract if cooperation has already been established

or

b) Smart4Aviation Group will consider own risk mitigating actions, on the part of Smart4Aviation Group in order to minimize risks

or

c) if neither, point a nor b, can be applied, such risk must be further processed as an enterprise risk according to Risk Management Policy .

C-level management shall be involved in above-mentioned considerations.

6. Supplier Off-boarding
------------------------

When Contract expires or is terminated and when, as part of the cooperation, the Supplier received some access, data, or other assets of S4A Group, below actions shall be taken by NEED Requestor:

* revoke access - immediately cut off all system, data, and physical access for the Supplier (if necessary, to revoke access, NEED Requestor shall contact the person who granted it at NEED Requestor request),
* retrieve data - retrieve all Information of the S4A Group from the Supplier, reclaim all company-owned physical and digital assets.

**7. Exceptions to the application of the policy**
--------------------------------------------------

In exceptional circumstances such as emergency or time-sensitive situations (example: a critical IT system fails, and an emergency supplier is needed to perform immediate repairs) upon the consent of the C-level management, it is permitted not to apply the rules set out in this policy.

Notwithstanding the above, S4A Group will do its best to minimize the risk with its own resources.

If necessary, enterprise risk procedure according to Risk Management Policy shall apply.
