Support Procedure
-----------------

---

1. The incident has occurred
2. Client or S4A initiates the MI procedure as per the daily agreed procedures for the specific client
3. Support manager should notify S4A management of MI via Slack channel [#topic-support-mi](https://s4agroup.slack.com/archives/C071H985NMP)
4. For high priority incidents (Blocker, Critical) suspected to be functional issues, involve the Product Owner ([click here to check PO](https://confluence.s4a.aero/display/PRODUCTS/S4A+Products+Home)).

   1. If PO is not available, involve Mike Lewis.
   2. If issue is related to DB, OS, queue, cache or product bug – do not involve Product Owner.
5. Create Slack chat and add responsible parties.
6. Incident resolution process finished
7. Send email to the client with information that the problem is solved
8. Report hours spent in days off system (this same day or next day morning) - How to report hours from Incident in Jira
9. Make sure Root Cause Analysis is performed for respective MI as soon as possible

   1. Create a dedicated Slack channel if there isn't already one and add responsible parties
   2. Inform PDM via SMS to take a look first thing in the morning if the issue is reported outside business hours

Payments
--------

---

* The support during MI is paid per hours.
* Support hours are calculated and paid around the 20th of each month.
* each received call from the customer or other support members - is counted as:

  + 07.00-17.00 - standard working hour
  + 17.00-21.00 - 2x working hour
  + 21.00-07.00 - 3x working hour
  + weekends/holidays - 3x working hour (of course holidays as last resort action)
* How to calculate Hour rate = (salary) / 172
* In case of part-time employees "salary" (in the example above) should be considered as if they were working full time
* Only confirmed support incidents (email with hours this same day or next day morning) will be paid
* Only fully described incidents will be paid
* Hours can be replaced for additional time off (time spend on incident will be counted as worked time in JIRA, so you can work less next day, week, etc)
* The time spent on standby cannot infringe upon the daily right to rest, which amounts to 11 hours, as well as the weekly right to rest, which amounts to 35 hours.

Cost return
-----------

---

* Cost reimbursement for using private phones is possible

Requirements
------------

---

* **You must want to solve a problem**
* Access to Internet
* Installed support tools (VPN, other...)
* Be available on the phone

Rules for MI - first line support
---------------------------------

---

1. First line manages the incident/root cause
2. If you are tired - ask 2nd person from first line to help/replace you
3. Engage PO/PDM if needed
4. First line makes sure there are no loose ends - ideas that were not checked/statements not verified
5. Summarize the incident or root cause analysis up to date - ideas checked, verification finished, next steps - at least once an hour
6. If we hit a dead end we should review the overall discussion incident and look for ideas that has slipped
