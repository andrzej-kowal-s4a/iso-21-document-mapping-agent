Service transition to prod schema
=================================

**At least 2 months before GO LIVE** PM should start completing the checklist. It is recommended to review this procedure on project start.

---

Warranty period - period when support is given mostly by a project team, standby support is required (see the procedure here Standby Support). After working hours support team will takeover issue handling.

Operations - is a stable state operations where only minor changes to the service are required.

All customer related monitoring should be requested and documented by Jira ticket according to following procedure:  <https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/display/S4A/New+NAGIOS+monitoring+request+procedure>  Final Monitoring setup and tests should be done prior to service transition to support. This means it should be running for some time (1 month at least) and should not deliver any false-positive alerts and it's final state should be agreed by both parties - Project Team and Support Team.  In case of the upgrade - monitoring has to be set up and tested on pre-prod, UAT env in order to avoid problems with unstable monitoring after golive (e.g. case of R30 in UAE)  **Caller to support 24/7**: It should be enabled at last a week before go live, or if deemed necessary by the PM during UAT test (possibily limited set of checks). | Open |  |  |  | Contact:   Project Manager |  |

|  | Double check prod env config vs test env configuration. Was there load test perform in prod env? (if out of our scope we should recommend   that to the client)  Are there things that can be only tested in PROD - for example node by node deployment, as there is only single app server in TEST env, or some interfaces working only in prod etc. - if there are - we need to list them and raise as risks (within the project and inform the client).  Are there product related configurations differences between PROD and TEST that are a risk from testing perspective - for example - different setting with regards to cache configuration like NOTAMS history, active flights history; different interfaces flows - volume for example - if there are - we need to list them and raise as risks (within the project and inform the client).  **NOTE:** At this stage it is not possible to get a simple list of checks - this has to be done by LDT, admins, technical team - maybe as a result some kind of checklist could be prepared.  Support suggest to focus on the following: products cash settings, amount of data in the database, environment architecture, interfaces - inbound, outbound, volume and data quality. | Open |  |  |  | Contact:   Project Manager |  |

|  | Check if account in sFTP is created | Open |  |  |  | Contact: Project Manager, [admins@smart4aviation.aero](mailto:admins@smart4aviation.aero) |  |
