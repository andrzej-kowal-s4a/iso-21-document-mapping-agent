If you do not have access to certain page in Confluence you can request access to it.

Please follow these steps:

1. Before requesting an access to given page - make sure you have access to the whole space your page is located at. If you are missing space access - ask space owner to grant you access to it, if you are unsure how to proceed with that, use below procedure just add info that you do not have access to space.
2. Create <https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/browse/INTHELP> ticket and provide requested **page link** or name of the Confluence Space with appropriate **reason**.
3. Assign the ticket to the proper person:

   1. If you need access to sensitive data like password - You should assign it to the **page owner** or **PM/IC** if it is ongoing project, or **support team** (if it is support related page) to speed up whole process.
   2. If you need access to other pages (without sensitive data) - You should assign it **page owner** or **space owner.**
4. Note that **Request access** button, available in confluence, will send request to **page owner** only and might not be properly revised due to Atlassian strange policy - so use this procedure instead
