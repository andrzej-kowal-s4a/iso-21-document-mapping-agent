1. **Procedure of version baseline preparation (Dev- 4+ weeks)**
   1. **DRAFT**: PDM creates baseline page and provides all required information: (template available: )
      1. PDM adds capacity info to the request.
      2. PO-PDM jointly review backlog and agree on version scope
      3. PDM/PO adds selected scope (Jira Epics) to request. (Same table as is currently used in Confluence)
      4. PDM: dev start & end date,  deadline for initial/final
      5. PO puts forward version proposal for approval. Informs CRB Moderator that request is ready for approval.
   2. **DB VERIFICATION:** CRB Moderator either approves or reverts back to DRAFT status. If approved, adds to the next meeting agenda and sends out the reminder on Friday. If rejected, provides explanation on Confluence page.  
      1. Baseline version draft to be presented by PO during the meeting
2. **Procedure of version baseline review and correction (Dev- 3 weeks)**
   1. 1. If baseline approved during previous meeting - all changes processed via CRB
      2. Baseline version draft to be presented by PO during the meeting

         - PDM sends out invitation for verification. Invitation must include verification end date
      2. Online verification (if PDM requests so, if baseline is not approved 2.5 week before start of development) :
