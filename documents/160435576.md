Purpose
=======

Each issue reported by customer will have the Owner assigned. The Owner is responsible for issue monitoring and its successful resolution. In case of problems with the resolution, owner shall escalate it (internal or external escalation).

Procedure
=========

In order to create a business value for customers, each customer's request shall be processed without a delay (within defined KPIs). Making one person responsible for a given issue removes all the doubts and should eliminate the backlog of not updated issues. Owner should keep the project backlog clean and tidy.

Key points and assumptions:

1. Owner is responsible for:

   1. Making sure that issue will be resolved without necessary delay
   2. Updating the issue with the current status (minimum Status, Comment and NextCheckDate fields shall be updated)
   3. In case of problems with issue resolution, it shall be escalated according to the defined procedures (internal escalation, external escalation)
   4. Escalation does not remove the responsibility from the owner unless otherwise agreed between owner and party that received the escalation
2. For issues reported by the customer from the PROD environment - the Owner will be appointed from the Support team
3. For issues reported by the customer from implementation/migration projects - the Owner will be appointed from the IC team since the Support is not yet involved in the project
4. Owner will be assigned to the CS\* tickets by JIRA automation during the issue creation
5. Owner can be changed if that was agreed between the current owner and the new owner
6. Update shall be performed on a weekly basis

   1. for items that are waiting for a major upgrade - update can be performed once per quarter (NextCheckDate mechanism)
7. There are some automation tool implemented in JIRA - e.g. automated updates in "Customer verification" or "Provide more information" - this is only a supporting tool - Owner is still responsible for the given item
8. For longer absence (e.g. holidays) Owner is responsible for finding a replacement Owner for issues that will need update over the absence period.
