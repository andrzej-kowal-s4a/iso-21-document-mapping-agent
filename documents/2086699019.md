Purpose
=======

This policy establishes the framework for planning, conducting, reporting, and following up on internal audits of the Information Security Management System (ISMS). It ensures audits evaluate conformity with ISO 27001 clauses, Annex A controls, and internal normative documents to maintain ongoing compliance and continual improvement.

Scope
=====

This policy applies to internal audits covering:

* ISO 27001 requirements (clauses 4 through 10)
* All ISO 27001 Annex A controls
* Company internal normative documents (policies, procedures, standards, guidances) for relevance and compliance
* Other internal requirements deemed necessary

Audit Program
=============

1. Audits shall assess relevance and compliance of the above areas. Process owners are ultimately responsible for facilitating audits within their areas, along with deployment of mitigations or remediations of the findings.
2. An audit program shall be established defining audit frequency, scope, and responsibilities based on risk and prior audit results.
3. Audits shall follow structured and consistent approach including planning, evidence gathering, analysis, reporting, and follow-up.
4. Competence:

   * Considering the context and constraints of a small to medium enterprise, auditors must be selected to ensure objectivity and impartiality; they must not audit their own work.
   * Auditors must have demonstrate competence in ISO 27001 requirements, subject matter and audit techniques.

Findings
========

1. Audit findings will be classified as:

   * Nonconformities (any deviation from ISO 27001 or company requirements)
   * Observations (areas that may present risks but are not nonconformities)
   * Improvements (suggestions that enhance ISMS effectiveness)
2. Reporting shall comply with following requirements:

   * All nonconformities must be reported as Jira issues, preferrably as per Security Nonconformity Policy.
   * Nonconformities in Jira shall be prioritized according to the internal bug level scale (blocker, critical, major, minor, trivial).
   * Observations and improvements shall be documented and communicated in audit reports, with recommendations for management consideration.
   * Audit reports with summarized findings, classifications, and evidence shall be provided to relevant management and retained as documented evidence.
3. Remediation and tracking:

   * All actions resulting from the audit, including mitigation, remediation and improvements, shall be tracked via Jira. They should be assigned to responsible parties, planned and executed, with clear deadlines.
   * Progress of corrective and preventive actions shall be monitored through Jira until closure and verified during follow-up audits.

Records and Documentation
=========================

* All audit plans, reports, Jira issues related to nonconformities, corrective action evidence, and follow-up results shall be maintained as part of the ISMS documentation for compliance and management review.
* There shall be sufficient evidence: links to documents, code, software artifacts, CI/CD jobs, tickets, logs, record entries and other forms of documented information, related to a given auditable requirement. In cases where collection of the evidence is not feasible due to effort, there shall be documented information where, how, and by whom to get the evidence artifacts if needed.

Continuous Improvement
======================

1. Audit results and remediation status shall be inputs to management reviews.
2. The audit program and methodology will be periodically reviewed and improved based on findings, changes in business risk, and evolving requirements.
