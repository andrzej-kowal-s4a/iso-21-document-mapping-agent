**General note:** The final SLA parameters are subject to the final conditions agreed in the new SOW (currently under discussion)

Hours of Coverage
=================

* Support and Maintenance Services – for Severity 1,2 failures: 24 hrs / day, including weekends and public holidays (call to S4A emergency line required).
* Severity 3 failures: from 09:00 – 17:00 CET-DST, excluding public holidays in Poland and weekends.

Incident Severity Level
=======================

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Defect Categories** | **Definition** |
| **Blocker (1)** | The defect blocks deployment and/or block any testing work, production could not run.  Example: Unsuccessful installation, All or significant number of users can't access to Application Software. |
| **Critical (2)** | The defect affects critical functionality or critical data (severe impact on the whole airline operation, severe impact on flight security). It does not have a Workaround. This also includes defects which make testing impossible.  Example: complete failure of a feature, severe problems on urgent airport or navigation information update (i.e. NOTAMs). |
| **Major (3)** | The defect affects major functionality or major data (continuous difficulties in using the Supplier Application Software). There is a Workaround available for this functionality and defect allows testing.  Example: Problems on NOTAM insertion, status not updated, alerts not updated, frequent disconnections of users during their shift. |
| **Minor (4)** | The defect affects minor functionality or non-critical data (a problem that has no measurable impact upon the commercial operation. It has an easy Workaround.  Example: A minor feature that is not functional in one module but the same task is easily doable from another module. |
| **Trivial (5)** | Minor documentation deficiencies; cosmetic problems; printouts are not well structured or information might be misleading. |

The priority level to be assigned to an Error is to be determined by the Client in consultation with the Supplier.

In the event that a priority 1, 2 Error is reported, apart from Issue Tracking Software, such reporting should always be confirmed by telephone to Smart4Aviation Helpdesk. The Client shall endeavour to provide the Supplier all relevant information to enable an analysis of the Error report.

In the event that the Supplier fails to find a solution acceptable to the Client within the applicable time for Error Fixes, or in the event that it becomes clear that the solution will require more time than estimated, as applicable, the Supplier shall engage additional staff, including also engagement of third party specialists.

The unavailability or solving time shall not include:

* the time necessary to solve the problems in the Client's Third Party Software, the hardware, the communication system, database or any other problems with services supplied by the Client.
* the time of waiting for a response from the Client's provider to the questions asked by the Supplier on the subject matter of the Service Request;
* the time of unavailability of the employee of the Client who is supposed to provide the personal support necessary to diagnose and fix the Errors or to test the proposed solution;
* the time of the Acceptance Tests run by the Client;
* The time of waiting for data requested by the Supplier i.e log files, database queries results etc.

In case the Client escalates the priority of an issue to higher, the count of the Response Times and Resolution Times shall be reset accordingly but shall not exceed the initial Priority Level Response Time. Should the priority of an issue be escalated to a Major Incident, such change must be additionally confirmed by phone. If the Client de-escalates the priority level of an issue (ex from Critical to Major) the Response Time and Resolution Time will not be reset and the original start time will apply.. If the priority of an Error is not defined, the Supplier is entitled to automatically define it as a Minor.

For the support issues on the Production Environment following Response Times and Resolution Times will be applied:
