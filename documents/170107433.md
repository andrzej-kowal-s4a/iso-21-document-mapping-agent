To ensure that the Suite is feed with ongoing bugfixes and have a reasonable and repeatable release process we run following releases procedure:

1. CORE is releasing maintenance Version every Tuesday - until 17.00. In case Tuesday is free day release should be done one day earlier.
2. Other products are releasing maintenance Version every Thursday - until 17.00. In case Thursday is free day release should be done one day earlier.
3. Suite Automated verification scripts will be started on Thursday 18.00. Friday is to fix blocking issues
4. Installation will be performed on Mondays on certification environment.

Each product is obliged to prepare release. The only reason not to release maintenance is lack of bugfixes.
