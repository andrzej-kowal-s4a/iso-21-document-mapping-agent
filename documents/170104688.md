**1.0 Introduction**
====================

Change Management refers to a formal process for making changes to IT systems. The goal of change management is to increase awareness and understanding of proposed changes across an organization and ensure that all changes are made in a thoughtful way that minimize negative impact to services and customers.

The purpose of change management is to control the life-cycle of all changes, enabling beneficial changes to be made with minimum disruption to services.

The objectives of change management are to:

* Respond to changing business requirements while maximizing value and reducing incidents, disruption and re-work
* Respond to RFCs that will align services with business needs
* Ensure that changes are recorded and evaluated, and that authorized changes are prioritized, planned, implemented, tested, documented and reviewed in a controlled manner
* Optimize overall business risk

2.0 Definitions
===============

2.1 Change
----------

For the purposes of this document, a change will be defined as anything that creates, transforms, modifies or removes the operating environment or standard operating procedures of any system or service that has the potential to affect the stability and reliability of the infrastructure or disrupt the business of the Smart4Aviation or customers.

2.2 Change types
----------------

By ITIL definition there are three types of changes:

* Standard Change   
  - a repeatable low risk change that has been pre-authorized by the Change Authority by means of a documented procedure that controls risk and has predictable outcomes. Relatively common and follows a procedure or work instruction.
* Normal Change    
   - a change that is not an Emergency change or a Standard change. Normal changes follow the defined steps of the change management process.
* Emergency Change   
  - a change that must be introduced as soon as possible due to likely negative service impacts (e.g. to resolve a major incident or implement a security patch). There may be fewer people involved in the change management process review, and the change assessment may involve fewer steps due to the urgent nature of the issue; however, any Emergency Change must still be authorized by a manager and reviewed by the Change Advisory Board retroactively.

3.0 Scope
=========

The scope of change management covers changes to all service elements across whole service lifecycle i.e. addition, modification or removal of anything that could have an effect on service including changes to architecture, processes, tools, metrics and documentation provided by Smart4Aviation.

4.0 Policy
==========

All Changes to IT services must follow a structured process to ensure appropriate planning and execution.

Change management include the following steps:

* Planning: Plan the change, including the implementation design, schedule, communication plan, test plan, and roll back plan.
* Evaluation: Evaluate the change, including determining the risk based in priority level of service and the nature of the proposed change, determining the change type and the change process to use
* Review: Review change plan with peers and/or Change Advisory Board as appropriate to the change type
* Approval: Obtain approval of change by management or other appropriate change authority as determined by change type.
* Communication: Communicate about changes with the appropriate parties (targeted or campus-wide).
* Implementation: Implement the change.
* Documentation: Document the change and any review and approval information.
* Post-change review: Review the change with an eye to future improvements

Important note: No changes are allowed on customer production env without written approval of proper authority.

5.0 Implementation
