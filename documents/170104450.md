**Purpose of this page is to establish common procedure for introducing new NAGIOS monitoring - it will help to answer a few important questions such us like who should be owner of the alert, validity of request etc. and most importantly how we should react if such alert arises.**

All below points have to be addressed in case new NAGIOS monitoring is requested, despite to which environment it applies.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. In order to introduce new NAGIOS monitoring creation of Jira ticket in corresponding Jira Project e.g. UAEINT (type: "Task", component: "ITAdmins", status: "Waiting 4 product") is a must. Reporter should:

* All mentioned below Jira ticket subjects should state explicitly what is the impact when such alert is received e.g. "\_app\_health\_brief-group\_cluster" - NOT correct, "BRIEF cluster unhealthy" - correct
* In case new monitoring is not client specific - Jira ticket subject should include naming of the new NAGIOS monitoring along with word "GENERIC" e.g. "GENERIC - BRIEF cluster unhealthy"
* In case new monitoring is client specific - Jira ticket subject should include naming of the new NAGIOS monitoring along with customer ICAO code e.g. "AFR - company notes webservice not working" (S4A if it's our internal monitoring)
* In description field of Jira ticket please include such informations as:

*Business impact:* - description what it is related to in terms of e.g. airline operations, what part of application could be affected if alerts is received, what we are trying to prevent from happening

*What needs to be monitored:* - technical specification like exact/particular SQL statement, description of resource or process we need to monitor - in case this is unknown for applicant - please ask administrators or someone more experienced in the field

*Monitoring thresholds:* - please provide thresholds for two NAGIOS alert levels - WARN and CRITICAL e.g. in case of SQL "select count(\*) from..." statement amount of records returned in order for NAGIOS to raise WARN alert or CRITICAL alert

*How to react:* - steps that needs to be done by Administrators, IC or Support Team Members to fix issue once such alert is received, in as detailed manner as it can be

*Reaction times:* - statement how important such alert is in terms of reaction time/hours with division for environments e.g. PROD: 24x7, PRE-PROD: 8x5, TE: NONE  -  where 24x7] - All week days, constantly ( 00:00-24:00 ), [8x7] - All week days, during business hours only ( 09:00 - 17:00 ), [8x5] -  Working days only (Mon-Fri), during business hours only ( 09:00 - 17:00 ), NONE - no need to react, alert just to inform that such issue happened

*Responsibility for taking an action:* - owner of the alert - this should be an information who should or most importantly who is able to react in case of such alert (Administrators, IC, Support Team)

* All other Jira fields like "Customer ICAO", "Priority" should be filled in according to common sense and to the best knowledge of reporter

2. S4A Employee who will be assigned to Jira ticket or who will be putting such monitoring in place should include Jira ticket url, related to monitoring, as a "notes\_url" value in NAGIOS configuration file, in new service description

e.g.:

bashdefine service {
use epwa-afr-service
host epwavapp20.dc.s4a.aero
service\_description [WCDC][AFR][PROD]\_security company notes webservice error number
check\_command check\_nrpe!check\_security\_cnotes\_websrv\_errors\_count
contact\_groups epwavapp20.dc.s4a.aero-contacts
max\_check\_attempts 1
notes\_url https://jira.s4a.aero/browse/AFRINT-1534
}

3. Once new monitoring is in place appropriate group (Administrators, IC, Support Team Members) should be informed by person who introduced new NAGIOS alert about the fact. This can be checked in "*Responsibility for taking an action*" description in Jira.

To do that an email to appropriate email address should be sent: Administrators - <mailto:admins@s4a.aero>, IC - <mailto:iconsultants@s4a.aero>, Support Team - <mailto:Team_Support@s4a.aero>

4. New Owner (each person in assigned team) should check whether he has all the tools and knowledge needed to take the action in case such alert is received.
