# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 8.12 Data leakage prevention

## 1. Information Classification Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170101881

This policy establishes the foundation for data leakage prevention by defining information sensitivity levels (Secret, Private, Restricted, Sensitive, Disclosable) and specifying handling rules for each level. It directly supports the control's requirement to identify and classify information to protect against leakage, particularly for personal information and customer data.

## 2. Encryption and Cryptography Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170105815

This policy addresses data leakage prevention through encryption requirements for data at rest and in transit. It mandates full disk encryption on all devices, encryption of customer data under custody, and secure transmission of information outside secure systems - directly supporting the control's preventive measures against unauthorized disclosure.

## 3. Mobile Device Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106965

This policy governs the use of mobile devices (smartphones, tablets, laptops), which are key channels for potential data leakage. It addresses device configuration, data storage restrictions based on classification levels, authentication requirements, and physical security - aligning with the control's guidance on monitoring portable storage devices.

## 4. Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106633

This policy specifically addresses data leakage risks from personal devices used for work purposes. It prohibits storing Secret or Restricted data on BYOD devices, mandates encryption, requires security software installation, and establishes incident reporting procedures - directly supporting the control's requirement to monitor and prevent data leakage through mobile devices.

## 5. Employee Offboarding
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4AIH/pages/149520666

This procedure is critical for preventing data leakage when employees leave the organization. It includes comprehensive steps to revoke access, recover hardware, remove accounts from systems, and ensure data cannot be extracted during the departure process - addressing the control's requirement to prevent unauthorized disclosure by individuals.

## 6. Endpoint Software Audit Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/1994686607

This procedure establishes systematic auditing of software installed on company devices to detect unauthorized applications that could facilitate data leakage. It includes monthly reviews, software allow/block lists, and actions for discovered violations - supporting the control's detective capabilities to identify potential data leakage channels.

## 7. Personal Data Protection Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170101280

This comprehensive policy addresses data leakage prevention for personal data through risk-based security measures, access controls, authorization requirements, and confidentiality obligations. It specifically covers data transfer restrictions outside EEA and training requirements - aligning with the control's focus on preventing unauthorized disclosure of sensitive personal information.

## 8. Information Technology Acceptable Use Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106001

This policy establishes acceptable use rules for IT resources that prevent data leakage, including restrictions on data storage locations, email usage, internet access, and data handling based on sensitivity levels. It addresses both technical and behavioral aspects of preventing unauthorized information disclosure through corporate systems and communication channels.
