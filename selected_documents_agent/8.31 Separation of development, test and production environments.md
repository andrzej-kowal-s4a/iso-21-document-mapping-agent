# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 8.31 Separation of development, test and production environments

## 1. Procedure - Service transition to prod
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SUP/pages/160433255

This procedure directly addresses the transition of services from development/testing to production environments. It includes comprehensive checklists covering environment separation, authorization requirements, testing procedures, access controls, monitoring setup, and segregation of duties - all core requirements of Control 8.31.

## 2. Change Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104688

This policy establishes formal change control processes for all IT systems, including requirements for planning, evaluation, approval, and documentation of changes before deployment to production. It directly supports the control's requirement for documented rules and authorization for software deployment from development to production status.

## 3. Procedure - Deployment Validation Test
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170105878

This procedure standardizes testing performed after deployment to customer or production environments, ensuring that changes are tested in staging environments before being applied to production systems. It directly implements the control's requirement to test changes prior to production deployment.

## 4. Server management procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170107313

This procedure governs the lifecycle management of virtual machines and environments, including creation, approval, resource allocation, and decommissioning. It supports environment separation by establishing formal processes for environment creation, ownership assignment, and environment type designation (ad-hoc vs. permanent).

## 5. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This umbrella policy establishes requirements for environments to be separated by function (development, test, production) and for formal change control policies affecting production. It includes provisions for separation of duties, access management, and secure SDLC practices that underpin the environment separation requirements of Control 8.31.

## 6. Gerrit - access request
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170099777

This procedure controls access to the source code repository (Gerrit), implementing access controls and authorization requirements for different development teams and projects. It supports the control's requirement for managing access rights to development environments and enforcing segregation of duties in code review and deployment processes.

## 7. Product Development and Support Security Credentials Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106199

This procedure addresses the handling of security credentials across different lifecycle phases and environments, ensuring that production credentials are properly protected and separated from development/testing. It directly supports the control's requirement to protect production environments from unauthorized access by development personnel.

## 8. Information Classification Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170101881

This policy establishes data classification levels and handling requirements, directly supporting Control 8.31's requirement that sensitive production information should not be copied into development and testing environments unless equivalent controls are provided. It defines protection requirements based on data sensitivity levels.
