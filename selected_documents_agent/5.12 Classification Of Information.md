## 1. Information Classification Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170101881

This is the primary policy document directly addressing ISO 27001 Control 5.12. It establishes a comprehensive five-level classification scheme (Secret, Private, Restricted, Sensitive, Disclosable) based on confidentiality, integrity, and availability requirements. The policy defines information sensitivity levels, handling rules, ownership responsibilities, and provides detailed mapping of organizational units and data categories to appropriate classification levels, fully supporting the control's requirement for information classification according to security needs.

## 2. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This umbrella security policy includes a dedicated section on "Information Classification and Handling" that directly supports Control 5.12. It establishes that all information must be classified based on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, requires information owners to be assigned, mandates high confidentiality classification for customer information and personal data, and provides the overarching framework within which the Information Classification Policy operates.

## 3. Personal Data Protection Policy (Polityka Bezpieczeństwa Danych Osobowych)
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170101280

This policy addresses the classification and protection of personal data, which represents a critical category of information requiring high classification levels. It implements risk-based classification methodology, establishes specific handling requirements for personal data based on GDPR compliance, and ensures that personal data is classified at least as "Private" level or higher in the organization's classification scheme, directly supporting the control's requirements for classifying information based on legal and regulatory requirements.

## 4. Encryption and Cryptography Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170105815

This policy directly implements protective controls based on information classification levels. It specifies encryption requirements for data at rest and in transit based on classification (Secret, Restricted, Sensitive levels), ensuring that information classified according to Control 5.12 receives appropriate technical protection measures. The policy demonstrates how classification schemes translate into specific security controls for protecting information according to its sensitivity.

## 5. Information Technology Acceptable Use Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106001

This policy ensures that users understand their responsibilities for handling information according to its classification level. It explicitly requires users to handle information according to sensitivity levels outlined in the Information Classification Policy, establishes data protection requirements based on classification, and defines acceptable use rules that vary based on information sensitivity, supporting the control's objective of ensuring understanding of protection needs.

## 6. Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106633

This policy implements classification-based access and storage restrictions for personal devices. It explicitly prohibits storing Secret or Restricted classified data on BYOD devices, establishes security requirements that vary based on information sensitivity levels being accessed, and demonstrates how information classification drives specific technical and procedural controls for different device types and usage scenarios.

## 7. General Information Media Disposal Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104943

This policy ensures that classified and sensitive information is properly disposed of according to its classification level. It addresses the complete lifecycle management of classified information, including secure disposal requirements for media containing sensitive and classified data, supporting the control's guidance that classification should be reviewed over time and that protection requirements must be maintained throughout the information lifecycle.
