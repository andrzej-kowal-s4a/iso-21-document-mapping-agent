# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 8.29 Security testing in development and acceptance

## 1. Procedure - Service transition to prod
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SUP/pages/160433255

This procedure is highly relevant as it defines comprehensive acceptance criteria before systems go live, including security testing requirements such as vulnerability scanning (AWS Security HUB), load testing, verification of secure configurations, and validation that systems work without major issues. It ensures security testing is performed before deployment to production environments.

## 2. Procedure - Deployment Validation Test
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170105878

This procedure directly addresses the control requirement by standardizing the scope and documentation of tests performed after deployment. It defines systematic testing procedures that validate deployments meet security and functional requirements, ensuring applications work as expected before acceptance.

## 3. Vulnerability Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/214794244

This policy is essential for the control as it establishes the framework for identifying, evaluating, and treating vulnerabilities across software products, integrated systems, and infrastructure. It directly supports security testing requirements including vulnerability scanning and assessment using CVSS scoring, which aligns with the control's guidance on using automated tools like vulnerability scanners.

## 4. CVSS score mapping to Jira priorities
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/120783272

This procedure provides the critical methodology for prioritizing security vulnerabilities discovered during testing based on CVSS severity scores. It supports the control's requirement to evaluate test results against criteria and determine appropriate actions for security-related defects found during development and acceptance testing.

## 5. Tenable.io vulnerability scoring mapping to Jira priorities
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/197722193

This procedure complements vulnerability testing by defining how automated vulnerability scanner findings are prioritized using Tenable's VPR scoring. It directly supports the control's guidance on leveraging automated tools such as vulnerability scanners and verifying remediation of security-related defects discovered during testing phases.

## 6. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This overarching policy establishes mandatory security requirements for the entire SDLC, including requirements for security testing, secure coding practices, vulnerability testing, code reviews, and validation that systems work as designed prior to production deployment. It provides the foundational security framework that testing processes must validate against.

## 7. Change Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104688

This policy is relevant as it defines formal change control procedures that include testing and approval requirements before changes are deployed to production. It ensures security testing is integrated into the change lifecycle, with specific workflows for different types of changes including security patches and system upgrades.

## 8. Internal Auditing Policy for Security
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/2086699019

This policy supports the control by establishing independent acceptance testing and verification processes. It defines audit procedures to assess compliance with security requirements and ISO 27001 controls, providing assurance that security testing processes are properly implemented and effective throughout the development lifecycle.
