# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 8.22 Segregation of networks

## 1. Network General Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104105

This policy directly addresses network segregation requirements by defining how Smart4Aviation networks must be designed with security zones and network domains. It specifies that internal networks shall be segregated into zones with appropriate security controls between them, and mandates DMZ implementation for systems accessible from external networks. The policy covers gateway controls, firewalls, and network segmentation based on trust levels, which are core requirements of Control 8.22.

## 2. Wireless Network Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170105917

This policy specifically addresses wireless network segregation, a key aspect mentioned in Control 8.22 guidance. It mandates that wireless infrastructure must be separated from corporate networks, requires security-enforcing components at network boundaries, and specifies that guest networks must be segregated from corporate networks with proper traffic segregation. This directly supports the control's guidance on treating wireless access as external connections.

## 3. Firewall rules for Smart PORTAL Mobile iOS and Android
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170102960

This standard defines specific firewall rules and network access controls for mobile applications. It demonstrates implementation of network segregation by controlling traffic at perimeters through defined gateways and specifying allowed access between network domains, which aligns with the control's requirement to control traffic between security boundaries based on business needs.

## 4. Open VPN
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170107980

This policy addresses remote access to internal networks through VPN, which relates to network segregation by ensuring external connections are properly controlled through gateways. It describes authentication and authorization controls for accessing different network domains, and demonstrates how the organization segregates internal network access from external connections, supporting the control's guidance on gateway controls.

## 5. Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106633

This policy addresses network segregation from the perspective of BYOD devices, explicitly stating that BYOD devices must not directly connect to Smart4Aviation internal networks and must use remote connection models (VPN, SSL certificates). This demonstrates segregation between untrusted devices and the corporate network, implementing the principle of treating potentially untrusted connections through appropriate network security boundaries.

## 6. Encryption and Cryptography Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170105815

This policy supports network segregation by mandating encryption for data in transit between network domains and requiring VPN connections for external access. It ensures that when information crosses network boundaries between security zones, it maintains confidentiality and integrity through cryptographic controls, which complements the physical and logical segregation measures required by Control 8.22.

## 7. Server management procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170107313

This procedure addresses how servers are provisioned and managed across different environments (development, test, production), demonstrating logical network segregation. It includes considerations for environment types, security configurations, and separation of environments by function, which supports the control's requirement to segregate networks into domains based on criticality and organizational units.

## 8. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This umbrella policy establishes the foundation for network segregation by requiring that networks be designed with security zones of different trust levels and mandating that network connections between systems be identified, documented, and protected. It requires separation of internal systems from internet-accessible systems through appropriate segmentation and firewall deployment, providing the overarching framework that supports Control 8.22.
