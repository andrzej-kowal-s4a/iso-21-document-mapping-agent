# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 8.16 Monitoring activities

## 1. New NAGIOS monitoring request procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104450

This procedure directly addresses the control's requirement for monitoring networks, systems, and applications. It establishes a formal process for introducing new monitoring, defining alert thresholds (WARN and CRITICAL levels), reaction times, and ownership of monitoring activities—all key elements for detecting anomalous behavior and potential security incidents.

## 2. Vulnerability Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/214794244

This policy supports the monitoring control by establishing processes for identifying, evaluating, and reporting vulnerabilities across software products, systems, networks, and AWS infrastructure. Regular vulnerability scanning and assessment are essential monitoring activities that help detect security weaknesses and anomalous configurations before they can be exploited.

## 3. Security Incident Reporting Procedure / Procedura zgłaszania incydentów związanych z bezpieczeństwem
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104051

This procedure is critical for responding to monitoring alerts and suspected security incidents. It defines how to report security incidents (actual or potential breaches) that monitoring activities detect, establishing the link between detection through monitoring and incident response actions required by the control.

## 4. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This umbrella policy includes specific provisions requiring systems to be monitored for deviations from normal operations (clause 20), and establishes the overall framework for security monitoring as part of the Information Security Management System. It mandates monitoring for anomalous behavior and defines security objectives that monitoring activities support.

## 5. Network General Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104105

This policy contains a dedicated "Monitoring" section requiring protective monitoring solutions, continuous monitoring covering audit logs, IPS/IDS alerts, network security scanning, and analysis tools. It directly addresses the control's requirements for monitoring network traffic, system activity, logs from security tools, and detecting anomalous behavior.

## 6. Internal Auditing Policy for Security
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/2086699019

This policy establishes internal audit processes that verify the effectiveness of monitoring controls and compliance with ISO 27001 requirements. Auditing activities help ensure that monitoring systems are properly configured, maintained, and operating as intended to detect security incidents and anomalies.

## 7. Tenable.io vulnerability scoring mapping to Jira priorities
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/197722193

This procedure supports automated vulnerability monitoring and prioritization using Tenable.io, which provides continuous scanning and predictive prioritization of vulnerabilities. This enables proactive monitoring of systems for security weaknesses and configuration issues, supporting early detection of potential security incidents.

## 8. Endpoint Software Audit Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/1994686607

This procedure establishes systematic monitoring of software installed on company endpoints through monthly audits. It helps detect unauthorized or prohibited software that could represent anomalous behavior, malware, or security policy violations, directly supporting the control's objective of monitoring for potential security incidents.
