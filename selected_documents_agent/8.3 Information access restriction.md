## 1. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This umbrella policy document establishes the foundation for access management throughout Smart4Aviation Group. It includes comprehensive provisions on access management principles, least privilege, role-based authorization, privileged access restrictions, and requirements for authentication and authorization.

## 2. Information Classification Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170101881

This policy is critical for Control 8.3 as it defines information sensitivity levels (Secret, Private, Restricted, Sensitive, Disclosable) and establishes rules for handling information according to its classification. The policy directly supports access restriction requirements by determining which user identities can access specific data classes, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information, and providing the classification framework needed to implement proper access controls.

## 3. Information Technology Acceptable Use Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106001

This policy directly addresses user responsibilities for accessing and using information systems, including provisions on user identity management, password protection, data protection requirements, and restrictions on accessing information without valid business need. It complements Control 8.3 by defining acceptable use boundaries and ensuring users only access information necessary for their duties.

## 4. Encryption and Cryptography Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170105815

This policy supports Control 8.3's guidance on protecting information through encryption and controlling access to data at rest and in transit. It establishes encryption requirements for data access scenarios, key management procedures, and authentication requirements for accessing encrypted information, which are essential technical controls for restricting information access.

## 5. Network General Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104105

This policy directly addresses network-level access restrictions through device security, network segmentation, access controls, ACLs, firewalls, VPN policies, and remote connection controls. It supports Control 8.3 by defining how access to information is controlled and restricted at the network infrastructure level, including controls for isolating sensitive applications and data.

## 6. Onboarding Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104063

This procedure establishes the process for granting initial access rights to new employees including LDAP account creation, group assignments, authentication setup, and access privilege provisioning. It ensures that access is properly authorized and restricted from the start of employment, supporting Control 8.3's requirements for proper identity management and access authorization.

## 7. Offboarding Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104057

This procedure ensures that access rights are properly revoked when employees leave the organization, including revoking privileges, disabling accounts, and removing access to systems and information. It directly supports Control 8.3 by preventing unauthorized access after employment termination and ensuring information remains protected throughout the access lifecycle.

## 8. Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Policy

This policy establishes access restrictions for personal devices accessing corporate information, including authentication requirements, encryption mandates, restrictions on storing Secret/Restricted data on BYOD devices, and security controls to prevent unauthorized access. It addresses Control 8.3's requirements for controlling which devices can access sensitive information and preventing anonymous/uncontrolled access.
