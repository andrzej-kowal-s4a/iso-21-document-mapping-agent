# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 8.26 Application security requirements

## 1. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This umbrella policy establishes the foundation for application security by defining mandatory security requirements for all IT systems including secure software development lifecycle (SDLC), security controls implementation, secure coding practices, vulnerability testing requirements, and change management for production systems. It directly addresses the control's requirement to identify and specify security requirements when developing or acquiring applications.

## 2. Vulnerability Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/214794244

This policy directly addresses application security by establishing a comprehensive approach to identifying, evaluating, and treating vulnerabilities in software products, integrated SUITE deployments, and environments. It covers CVSS scoring, vulnerability remediation strategies, and the treatment of security defects - all critical aspects of ensuring application security requirements are met throughout the application lifecycle.

## 3. Procedure - Service transition to prod
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SUP/pages/160433255

This procedure implements extensive security checks and validation requirements before applications move to production, including security configuration verification, access control validation, monitoring setup, vulnerability assessment, authentication controls, backup security, and interface security. It ensures that application security requirements are validated and approved before deployment.

## 4. Change Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104688

This policy ensures that all changes to applications and IT services follow a structured process with appropriate security evaluation, testing, and approval. It addresses security requirements for application changes through various workflows including customer bugs, enhancements, functional changes, infrastructure modifications, and upgrades - ensuring security is considered throughout the application lifecycle.

## 5. Encryption and Cryptography Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170105815

This policy directly addresses security requirement (i) from the control regarding the need to securely encrypt communications and protect data in transit and at rest. It establishes mandatory encryption standards for data protection, cryptographic key management, and approved algorithms - essential components of application security requirements.

## 6. Information Classification Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170101881

This policy addresses security requirements (b), (f), and (g) from the control by identifying the type and classification level of information processed by applications, determining confidentiality protection requirements, and establishing handling rules for different sensitivity levels. It ensures applications implement appropriate security controls based on data classification.

## 7. CVSS score mapping to Jira priorities
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/120783272

This procedure establishes the risk-based approach to prioritizing application security vulnerabilities using CVSS v3 scoring framework. It directly supports the control by providing a standardized method for evaluating application security vulnerabilities and ensuring they are addressed according to their severity and potential impact.

## 8. Product Development and Support Security Credentials Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106199

This procedure addresses security requirement (a) regarding authentication and secure handling of security credentials throughout the application lifecycle. It establishes rules for password management, secure credential deployment, least privilege implementation, and security by design principles - all essential for meeting application security requirements during development and operations.
