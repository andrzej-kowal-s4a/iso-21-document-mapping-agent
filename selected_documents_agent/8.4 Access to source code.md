# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 8.4 Access to source code

## 1. Gerrit - access request
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170099777

This procedure directly addresses source code access management through Gerrit, the source code management system. It establishes formal processes for requesting, approving, and granting read/write access to source code repositories, including role-based access controls and approval workflows, which are core requirements of Control 8.4.

## 2. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This umbrella policy establishes fundamental security requirements including access management principles, separation of duties, and software systems security. It specifically states that "application source code shall be stored in secure internal repository" and addresses privileged access to production systems, which directly supports the confidentiality and integrity objectives of Control 8.4.

## 3. Change Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104688

This policy is essential for Control 8.4 as it establishes formal change control procedures for all IT systems including source code modifications. It defines authorization processes, documentation requirements, and audit trails for changes to source code and development tools, helping prevent unauthorized functionality introduction as required by the control.

## 4. HOW To add SSH key to LDAP
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170105282

This procedure supports secure authentication for source code access by managing SSH keys in LDAP. SSH keys are commonly used for authenticating access to source code repositories and development tools, making this procedure relevant to controlling who can access and modify source code as specified in Control 8.4.

## 5. Onboarding Procedure / Procedura wdrożenia
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104063

This procedure ensures proper provisioning of access rights including source code repository access (Gerrit) during employee onboarding. It establishes role-based access assignment to development teams and source code management groups in LDAP, ensuring that access to source code is appropriately managed from the start of employment.

## 6. Employee Offboarding
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4AIH/pages/149520666

This procedure is critical for Control 8.4 as it ensures timely revocation of access to source code repositories, development tools, and all technical systems when employees leave. It includes specific steps for deactivating LDAP accounts, removing from development groups, and revoking access grants, preventing unauthorized access to valuable intellectual property.

## 7. Vulnerability Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/214794244

This policy addresses the security of source code by establishing processes for identifying, evaluating, and remediating vulnerabilities in software products including those introduced during development. It supports Control 8.4's objective of preventing unintentional changes and maintaining integrity of source code through systematic vulnerability management.

## 8. Internal Auditing Policy for Security
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/2086699019

This policy establishes audit processes to verify compliance with security controls including those related to source code access management. Regular audits help ensure that access to source code, development tools, and software libraries is appropriately managed according to ISO 27001 requirements and internal policies, providing assurance that Control 8.4 is effectively implemented.
