## 1. Procedure: Baseline Management
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104985

This procedure directly addresses information security integration in project planning by establishing a formal baseline management process for product versions. It includes structured governance through Change Review Board (CRB) approval, ensures security considerations are embedded in the planning phase, and defines clear approval criteria and responsibilities for projects throughout their lifecycle.

## 2. Procedure: Change to Baseline Management
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106091

This procedure complements baseline management by controlling subsequent changes to project plans through a formal Change Review Board process. It ensures that information security impacts are assessed when project scope changes, requires impact assessment preparation, and establishes a governance framework with defined roles and approval authorities for managing project changes.

## 3. Change Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104688

This comprehensive policy establishes the framework for integrating security into project management by requiring security risk assessment for all changes throughout the project lifecycle. It covers multiple change types (standard, normal, emergency), defines change authorities, and ensures that security considerations are addressed in planning, evaluation, review, approval, and implementation phases.

## 4. Procedure - Service transition to prod
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SUP/pages/160433255

This detailed procedure addresses information security integration throughout project delivery and transition phases. It includes comprehensive Service Acceptance Criteria covering security requirements verification, monitoring setup, disaster recovery testing, vulnerability management, access controls, and knowledge transfer - ensuring security risks are treated throughout the entire project life cycle.

## 5. Risk Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170100789

This policy provides the foundational framework for identifying, analyzing, and managing risks at both operational and strategic levels, including project-related risks. It establishes the methodology for integrating risk management into planning and decision-making processes, defines risk owners and responsibilities, and ensures risks are monitored and controlled throughout projects.

## 6. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This umbrella policy establishes the overarching security framework that must be integrated into all projects. It defines mandatory security requirements for systems development, requires security risk assessments for projects and new technologies, establishes secure SDLC requirements, and sets security responsibilities that apply throughout project management activities.

## 7. Vulnerability Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/214794244

This policy addresses how security vulnerabilities discovered during projects are identified, evaluated, and treated. It establishes the framework for assessing security risks related to project deliverables, defines treatment strategies (remediation, mitigation, acceptance), and ensures vulnerabilities are managed throughout the project lifecycle with appropriate security sign-offs.

## 8. Supplier Security Risk Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170099594

This policy ensures information security is integrated when projects involve external suppliers or third parties. It establishes security requirements for supplier on-boarding, requires security risk assessments for purchases and contracts, defines security criteria evaluation processes, and ensures supplier security capabilities are verified and monitored throughout project execution.
