# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 8.24 Use of cryptography

## 1. Encryption and Cryptography Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170105815

This is the primary policy document directly addressing cryptographic controls. It defines encryption requirements for data at rest and in transit, cryptographic key management procedures, approved encryption algorithms and standards (BitLocker, FileVault2, LUKS), key rotation intervals, and references the detailed Cryptography Standard. This document comprehensively addresses the control's requirements for rules on effective use of cryptography and key management.

## 2. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This umbrella security policy establishes the overall framework for information security management, including requirements for confidentiality, integrity, and availability protection. It contains provisions for software systems security, configuration hardening, and secure development practices that support the implementation of cryptographic controls across the organization's systems and processes.

## 3. Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106633

This policy mandates encryption requirements for personal devices used to access company data, including full disk encryption, encrypted connections via VPN or SSL certificates, and specific encryption requirements for mobile devices. It directly implements cryptographic controls for BYOD scenarios and addresses authentication mechanisms and secure data transmission.

## 4. Mobile Device Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106965

This policy establishes cryptographic protection requirements for mobile devices (smartphones, tablets, laptops) used for work purposes. It mandates encryption for devices storing non-disclosable company data and requires proper authentication mechanisms, supporting the control's requirements for cryptography to protect information on mobile devices and storage media.

## 5. Network General Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104105

This policy requires encryption for data in transit through VPN connections, mandates encryption and integrity checking for data transfer between trusted and untrusted networks, and establishes requirements for authentication controls and secure remote access. It implements cryptographic controls at the network level to protect confidentiality and integrity of transmitted information.

## 6. Wireless Network Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170105917

This policy mandates specific cryptographic standards for wireless networks, requiring WPA2 or later with CCMP encryption, disabling weak protocols (WEP, TKIP), and implementing authentication mechanisms for wireless connections. It ensures proper cryptographic protection for wireless network communications in compliance with the control's requirements.

## 7. Information Classification Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170101881

This policy establishes information sensitivity levels (Secret, Private, Restricted, Sensitive, Disclosable) and handling requirements for each classification. It provides the foundation for determining appropriate cryptographic protection levels based on data sensitivity, directly supporting the control's guidance on identifying required protection levels and implementing appropriate cryptographic algorithms.

## 8. General Information Media Disposal Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104943

This policy addresses the secure disposal and sanitization of media containing sensitive information, ensuring that cryptographic protection extends through the entire information lifecycle including decommissioning. It complements cryptographic controls by ensuring encrypted data on media is properly handled during disposal to prevent unauthorized recovery.
