# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 8.20 Networks security

## 1. Network General Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104105

This is the primary policy document that directly addresses network security management, including network segmentation, device security, access controls, firewall deployment, VPN requirements, monitoring, and configuration management. It comprehensively covers the control requirements for securing networks and network devices, making it essential for compliance with ISO 27001 Control 8.20.

## 2. Wireless Network Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170105917

This policy specifically addresses wireless network security, which is explicitly mentioned in the ISO control guidance (item e). It covers wireless network segmentation, authentication requirements, configuration standards including WPA2/CCMP, and security controls for wireless access points, ensuring protection of data passing over wireless networks.

## 3. Encryption and Cryptography Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170105815

This policy is critical for implementing controls to safeguard confidentiality and integrity of data passing over networks (as required by guidance item e). It defines encryption standards for data in transit, approved cryptographic algorithms, and key management practices essential for protecting network communications.

## 4. Open VPN
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170107980

This policy document establishes requirements for remote VPN access to internal networks, directly supporting the control's guidance on protecting data over public networks and authenticating systems on the network (guidance items e and h). It ensures secure remote connections through encrypted channels.

## 5. Server management procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170107313

This procedure addresses the management of network infrastructure components (servers) including their lifecycle management, configuration, and resource allocation. It supports maintaining up-to-date documentation of network devices and establishing responsibilities for network equipment management (guidance items b and c).

## 6. Firewall rules for Smart PORTAL Mobile iOS and Android
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170102960

This standard document defines specific firewall rules and network access requirements for mobile applications, directly supporting the control's guidance on restricting and filtering system connections to the network using firewalls (guidance item i). It demonstrates practical implementation of network security controls.

## 7. Vulnerability Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/214794244

This policy is relevant for identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in network devices and infrastructure, supporting the control's requirement for hardening network devices (guidance item k) and ensuring networks are secured from compromise. It establishes processes for detecting, evaluating, and remediating network security vulnerabilities.

## 8. New NAGIOS monitoring request procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104450

This procedure implements network and system monitoring capabilities, directly supporting the control's guidance on appropriately logging and monitoring to detect actions relevant to information security (guidance item f). It establishes processes for continuous monitoring of network services and infrastructure components.
