# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 8.17 Clock synchronization

## 1. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This overarching security policy explicitly requires that "Systems shall use consistent and trusted time source" (clause 19 under Software Systems Security). This directly addresses the control requirement and establishes the organizational commitment to clock synchronization across all information processing systems.

## 2. Server management procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170107313

This procedure governs the lifecycle management of servers and virtual machines, including their setup, configuration, and operational requirements. Server infrastructure requires accurate time synchronization for logging, monitoring, and coordination purposes, making this procedure essential for implementing clock synchronization controls on information processing systems.

## 3. New NAGIOS monitoring request procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104450

This monitoring procedure is directly relevant as it establishes processes for system monitoring and alerting. Accurate time synchronization is critical for correlating monitoring events, analyzing system logs, and investigating incidents—all of which are explicitly mentioned in the control's purpose statement regarding correlation and analysis of security-related events.

## 4. Security Incident Reporting Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104051

This procedure defines how security incidents are reported and managed. Synchronized clocks across all systems are essential for accurate incident correlation, timeline reconstruction, and forensic investigation—which directly supports the control's purpose of enabling investigations into information security incidents.

## 5. Internal Auditing Policy for Security
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/2086699019

This policy establishes the framework for auditing ISMS compliance including ISO 27001 Annex A controls. Clock synchronization compliance would be verified through internal audits, and accurate timestamps on audit evidence and audit logs are critical for maintaining the integrity of the audit process and supporting forensic analysis.
