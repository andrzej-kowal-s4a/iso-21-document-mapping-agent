# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 8.21 Security of network services

## 1. Network General Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104105

This policy is the primary document addressing network security for Smart4Aviation Group. It directly covers security mechanisms for network services including network design, security controls, device security, network access, network segmentation, VPN policy, authentication requirements, monitoring, and firewall requirements - all of which are essential elements required by ISO 27001 control 8.21 for managing security of network services.

## 2. Wireless Network Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170105917

This policy specifically addresses security requirements for wireless network services, including network segmentation, authentication requirements, configuration standards (WPA2, CCMP), and security controls. It provides detailed implementation guidelines for wireless network services security, which is explicitly mentioned in the ISO control guidance (network services accessed via wireless networks).

## 3. Open VPN
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170107980

This policy governs VPN services for remote access to internal networks, which is a critical network service requiring security mechanisms. It addresses authentication, authorization, and secure connection requirements for network services accessed remotely - directly supporting the control's requirement for security features like authentication and encryption for network services.

## 4. Encryption and Cryptography Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170105815

This policy establishes encryption standards for data in transit and at rest, including VPN connections and encrypted transmission protocols. Since the ISO control specifically mentions encryption as a security feature for network services and the need to protect network connections, this policy provides essential technical controls for securing network services.

## 5. Supplier Security Risk Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170099594

This policy is relevant for managing security requirements when network services are provided by external suppliers. The ISO control guidance explicitly states that organizations should ensure network service providers implement appropriate security measures and maintain the right to audit, which this policy addresses through supplier security assessments, contractual security requirements, and ongoing monitoring of third-party service providers.

## 6. Server management procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170107313

This procedure governs the management of servers that provide network services, including resource allocation, configuration management, security verification, and lifecycle management. It supports the control's requirement for monitoring service levels and ensuring appropriate management controls are implemented for network infrastructure that delivers network services.

## 7. Firewall rules for Smart PORTAL Mobile iOS and Android
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170102960

This standard defines specific firewall rules and network access controls for mobile application network services. It demonstrates implementation of network connection controls and access restrictions mentioned in the ISO control guidance, specifying which networks and network services are allowed to be accessed and the technical parameters for secure connections.

## 8. Company Managed Service Agreements
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170108066

This standard addresses service level agreements (SLAs) and operational level agreements (OLAs) for network services. The ISO control specifically requires that service levels and service requirements of network services be identified, implemented, and monitored. This document provides the framework for defining and managing these service levels and monitoring provider performance.
