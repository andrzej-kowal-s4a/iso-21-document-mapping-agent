# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 8.6 Capacity management

## 1. Server management procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170107313

This procedure directly addresses capacity management by defining the complete lifecycle for server resource allocation, monitoring, and management. It includes processes for requesting new virtual machines, verifying resource requirements (vCPU, RAM), reviewing environment usage, and managing resource changes. The procedure ensures capacity planning through regular verification checks and expiration reviews, which aligns with monitoring resource usage and adjusting capacity requirements as specified in the control.

## 2. New NAGIOS monitoring request procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104450

This procedure establishes monitoring capabilities essential for capacity management by defining how to introduce system monitoring with clear thresholds (WARN and CRITICAL levels). It ensures detective controls are in place to identify capacity and performance problems in due time, supporting the control's requirement for system monitoring to ensure availability and efficiency. The procedure includes defining reaction times and responsibilities, which supports proactive capacity issue detection.

## 3. S4A Disaster Recovery Plan
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170101158

The disaster recovery plan is relevant to capacity management as it addresses ensuring sufficient capacity and availability of critical systems during disruptions. It covers capacity requirements for backup systems and recovery capabilities, ensuring business continuity through adequate resource provisioning. This supports the control's purpose of ensuring required capacity of information processing facilities to maintain service availability.

## 4. Procedure - Service transition to prod
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SUP/pages/160433255

This comprehensive procedure includes multiple capacity-related requirements: load testing execution, memory settings review and approval, performance monitoring setup, verification of sufficient system capacity before production deployment, and stress-testing to confirm peak performance requirements. It ensures that capacity planning and validation occur before systems enter production, directly supporting the control's guidance on stress-testing systems to meet peak performance requirements.

## 5. License and hardware purchase or renewal process
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4AIH/pages/149520415

This procedure addresses capacity management for physical resources by defining the process for acquiring new hardware and licenses when additional capacity is needed. It ensures proper planning and approval for resource procurement, which supports the control's guidance on addressing resources with long procurement lead times and avoiding resource limitations that could threaten system security or services.

## 6. Purchasing Procedure for Standard Hardware
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/1633452033

This procedure defines hardware lifecycle management with specific lifespans (5 years for computers, 8 years for monitors) and replacement procedures. It ensures capacity planning for human resources by managing equipment availability and upgrades, supporting the control's requirement to ensure adequate capacity of facilities and avoid dependency issues. The procedure includes regular reviews of hardware standards to ensure equipment meets operational requirements.

## 7. Change Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104688

This policy is relevant to capacity management as it governs how changes to system resources and infrastructure are planned, evaluated, and implemented. It includes specific workflows for server resource allocation and infrastructure modifications, ensuring that capacity changes follow controlled processes. This supports the control's requirement for adjusting resources in line with capacity requirements while maintaining system stability and service availability.

## 8. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This umbrella security policy includes specific provisions for capacity management in section "Software Systems Security" (clause 18), which states that "Systems shall be analyzed for resource requirements; sufficient resources shall be assigned in order to maintain system performance and availability." It also covers monitoring systems for deviations from normal operations and ensuring availability of business-critical data, supporting the overall capacity management control objectives.
