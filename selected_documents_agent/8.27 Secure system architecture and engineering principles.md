# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 8.27 Secure system architecture and engineering principles

## 1. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This comprehensive umbrella policy establishes fundamental security requirements for system design, development, and operations, including separation of duties, security by design principles, secure SDLC, system hardening, network segmentation, and security controls integration across all architecture layers—directly supporting the control's requirements for establishing and documenting secure engineering principles.

## 2. Procedure - Service transition to prod
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SUP/pages/160433255

This procedure enforces secure system engineering principles through comprehensive pre-production verification requirements including security architecture review, vulnerability testing, monitoring setup, backup/DR testing, configuration hardening, least privilege verification, and ensures security controls are properly implemented before systems enter production operations.

## 3. Change Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104688

This policy establishes structured change management processes that ensure all system modifications follow secure engineering principles through proper planning, evaluation, review, approval, and testing—supporting the control's requirement for security to be designed into all architecture layers and ensuring changes don't compromise system security.

## 4. Vulnerability Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/214794244

This policy implements systematic vulnerability identification, evaluation, and remediation processes across products, infrastructure, and AWS environments, supporting the control's requirement to analyze security controls' capabilities to prevent, detect, and respond to security events and to ensure systems are designed against known attack patterns.

## 5. Network General Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104105

This policy establishes secure network architecture principles including defense in depth through network segmentation, security zones, DMZ implementation, firewall deployment, VPN security, and hardened network device configurations—directly implementing the control's requirements for security architecture principles like "defence in depth" and "security by default."

## 6. Encryption and Cryptography Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170105815

This policy establishes cryptographic controls for data protection at rest and in transit, key management, and approved encryption algorithms—supporting the control's requirement for specific security controls to protect sensitive information and ensuring encryption is integrated into the security architecture and technical infrastructure.

## 7. Server management procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170107313

This procedure implements secure system provisioning and lifecycle management with security considerations built into the request, verification, approval, and deployment process, ensuring systems are appropriately sized, monitored, and decommissioned securely—supporting the control's requirements for secure system engineering throughout the system lifecycle.

## 8. Information Classification Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170101881

This policy establishes data classification levels and handling requirements that inform security control selection and implementation across systems and architecture layers, directly supporting the control's requirement to analyze specific security controls required by particular business processes based on data sensitivity and protection needs.
