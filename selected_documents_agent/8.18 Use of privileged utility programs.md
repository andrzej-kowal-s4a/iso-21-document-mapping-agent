# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 8.18 Use of privileged utility programs

## 1. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This overarching policy establishes the framework for access management, including provisions for privileged access controls (Section 7 states "Privileged access to any production systems must be restricted"), separation of duties, and the principle of least privilege, which are fundamental requirements for controlling utility programs.

## 2. Server management procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170107313

This procedure defines comprehensive controls for server access and management, including authorization workflows, approval processes, and administrative access management. It directly addresses the control's requirements for restricting and documenting privileged utility program access to trusted, authorized administrators.

## 3. Employee Offboarding
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4AIH/pages/149520666

This procedure ensures removal of privileged access when employees leave, including deactivating LDAP accounts, removing from admin groups, revoking AWS access, and eliminating VPN access. It supports the control's requirement to limit utility program access to the minimum practical number of trusted, authorized users.

## 4. HOW To add SSH key to LDAP
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170105282

This procedure documents the authentication mechanism for privileged SSH access to systems, which is a common utility for system administration. It implements the control's requirement for identification, authentication and authorization procedures for utility programs.

## 5. Gerrit - access request
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170099777

This procedure establishes formal authorization processes for accessing Gerrit (code repository management), including approval workflows and documentation of access levels. It demonstrates implementation of the control's guidance on defining and documenting authorization levels for privileged utilities.

## 6. Endpoint Software Audit Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/1994686607

This procedure implements regular auditing of software installed on endpoints to ensure only authorized and approved software (including utility programs) is present. It directly supports the control's requirement to remove or disable unnecessary utility programs and maintain appropriate software controls.

## 7. Change Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104688

This policy provides the framework for controlling and documenting changes to systems, including those made using privileged utility programs. It addresses the control's requirement for authorization of ad hoc use of utility programs and logging through structured change management processes.

## 8. Internal Auditing Policy for Security
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/2086699019

This policy establishes the audit framework for verifying compliance with ISO 27001 controls, including Control 8.18. It supports ongoing monitoring and verification that privileged utility program usage is appropriately restricted, controlled, logged, and compliant with security requirements.
