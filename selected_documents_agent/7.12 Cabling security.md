This umbrella policy includes a Physical Security section that addresses security perimeters, security barriers, access controls, and protection of information processing and storage facilities from security threats and environmental hazards. These requirements directly support the physical protection aspects of cabling security, including ensuring cables in facilities are protected from unauthorized access and environmental damage.

## 2. Network General Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104105

This policy covers network infrastructure management including device security, physical access restrictions to network equipment, network segmentation, and protection of network components in locked storage or server rooms. It addresses the protection of network cabling infrastructure by requiring restricted physical access to network devices, which inherently protects the cables connecting them and supports proper segregation of network zones.

## 3. Procedura korzystnia z biura po godzinach pracy / After-Hours workplace activity procedure
