## 1. S4A Disaster Recovery Plan
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170101158

This is the most critical document for this control as it directly addresses disaster recovery planning, which is fundamental to maintaining information security during disruption. The Disaster Recovery Plan outlines procedures to restore security of information at required levels and timeframes following interruptions, which directly supports the control's requirement to maintain information security during disruption.

## 2. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This umbrella security policy establishes the overall framework for information security management including business continuity capabilities, security risk management, and ensuring operational robustness of customer-facing services. It explicitly addresses system availability, service continuity, and mentions that contingency plans (disaster recovery, business continuity) shall be tested periodically, which aligns with the control's guidance on maintaining security during disruption.

## 3. Security Incident Reporting Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104051

This procedure establishes the process for identifying, reporting, and initiating management of security incidents. During disruption, the ability to quickly identify and respond to security incidents is critical to maintaining appropriate security levels. This procedure is part of the overall Security Incident Management Plan which helps maintain information security controls during disruption events.

## 4. Major Incidents
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SUP/pages/160433356

This procedure defines how to handle major incidents affecting service availability and stability. It includes the incident resolution process, escalation procedures, and responsibilities during disruption, ensuring that information security is maintained through structured response processes. This directly supports the control's requirement for processes to maintain existing information security controls during disruption.

## 5. Communication procedure in case of Major Incident
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170102638

This procedure ensures effective communication during major incidents and service disruptions. Proper communication is essential for maintaining information security during disruption by ensuring stakeholders are informed, coordinated recovery activities, and proper execution of security controls. It addresses service degradation and unplanned downtime response procedures.

## 6. Change Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104688

This policy establishes controlled change management processes which are critical during disruption scenarios. It ensures that any changes made to IT systems during disruption (including emergency changes and compensating controls) are properly managed, approved, and documented, helping maintain security at appropriate levels during recovery and restoration activities.

## 7. Risk Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170100789

This policy provides the framework for identifying, analyzing, and managing risks including operational and enterprise risks. During disruption, understanding and managing security risks is essential. The policy supports business continuity planning by integrating risk management into strategic and operational planning, which helps ensure information security requirements are considered during disruption scenarios.

## 8. Procedure - Service transition to prod
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SUP/pages/160433255

This comprehensive procedure includes requirements for business continuity planning (BCP) and disaster recovery testing, backup procedures, and monitoring setup. It ensures that services are properly prepared for disruption scenarios with tested DR procedures, backup/restore capabilities, and documented recovery processes, all of which support maintaining information security during disruption.
