## 1. Mobile Device Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106965

This policy directly addresses mobile endpoint devices (smartphones, tablets, laptops) and establishes security frameworks for their use. It covers physical protection, device configuration, encryption requirements, access controls, and data handling - all key requirements of Control 8.1 for user endpoint device protection.

## 2. Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106633

This policy is essential for Control 8.1 as it specifically addresses the use of personal devices for work purposes. It covers security requirements, authentication, encryption, malware protection, remote wiping capabilities, and separation of personal and business data - directly supporting the control's guidance on BYOD usage and endpoint device protection.

## 3. Endpoint Software Audit Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/1994686607

This procedure implements Control 8.1's requirement for restricting and monitoring software installation on endpoint devices. It establishes a systematic approach to auditing installed software, maintaining allow/block lists, and ensuring compliance with security restrictions on company devices.

## 4. Encryption and Cryptography Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170105815

This policy directly supports Control 8.1's requirement for storage device encryption (point h). It mandates full disk encryption for all company-owned and personal devices storing company information, specifies encryption standards (BitLocker, FileVault2, LUKS), and covers encryption requirements for data at rest and in transit on endpoint devices.

## 5. Information Technology Acceptable Use Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106001

This policy establishes user responsibilities for endpoint device usage, including password protection, physical security, appropriate use, and behavior when using devices. It directly addresses Control 8.1's guidance on user responsibility and appropriate handling of endpoint devices accessing company information.

## 6. Wireless Network Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170105917

This policy supports Control 8.1's guidance on wireless connections (point f) by establishing security requirements for wireless endpoint device connectivity, including authentication requirements, encryption standards (WPA2/CCMP), and network segmentation to protect information accessed via user endpoint devices.

## 7. Employee Offboarding
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4AIH/pages/149520666

This procedure ensures proper handling of endpoint devices during employee departure, including hardware return, account deactivation, and data removal. It supports Control 8.1's requirements for endpoint device registration, physical protection, and remote deletion capabilities when devices are returned or access is terminated.

## 8. Vulnerability Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/214794244

This policy supports Control 8.1's requirement for keeping endpoint device software updated (point e) by establishing processes for identifying, evaluating, and remediating vulnerabilities in systems including endpoint devices, ensuring they are protected against known security weaknesses.
