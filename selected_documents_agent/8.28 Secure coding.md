# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 8.28 Secure coding

## 1. Vulnerability Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/214794244

This policy establishes the framework for identifying, evaluating, and treating security vulnerabilities in software products and systems. It directly supports secure coding by defining how vulnerabilities discovered in code are managed, prioritized using CVSS scoring, and remediated throughout the software lifecycle.

## 2. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This umbrella policy establishes mandatory requirements for software systems security, including secure SDLC practices, secure coding principles, code repository security, and vulnerability testing. It mandates that all software developed by Smart4Aviation must follow secure coding practices to avoid code vulnerabilities, directly aligning with Control 8.28.

## 3. Procedure - Service transition to prod
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SUP/pages/160433255

This comprehensive procedure ensures secure deployment practices including security testing, code review, vulnerability scanning, monitoring setup, and production readiness checks. It covers critical secure coding validation points such as ensuring no major security issues exist before production deployment and verifying that security configurations are properly implemented.

## 4. CVSS score mapping to Jira priorities
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/120783272

This procedure provides standardized vulnerability severity assessment and prioritization using CVSS v3 framework. It supports secure coding by establishing clear priorities for addressing security vulnerabilities discovered during code development and testing, ensuring critical coding vulnerabilities are addressed promptly.

## 5. Change Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104688

This policy establishes controlled processes for software changes including code modifications, ensuring all changes follow structured planning, evaluation, review, approval, and testing procedures. It supports secure coding by ensuring code changes are properly reviewed and tested before deployment to prevent introduction of security vulnerabilities.

## 6. Gerrit - access request
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170099777

This procedure controls access to the Gerrit code review system, ensuring only authorized developers can access and modify source code. It supports secure coding by implementing access controls for code repositories and the code review process, which are essential elements of secure software development mentioned in Control 8.28 guidance.

## 7. Procedure - Deployment Validation Test
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170105878

This procedure standardizes testing after deployment to ensure software functions securely and correctly. It supports secure coding by establishing validation testing requirements that verify security controls are properly implemented before systems become operational, addressing the testing requirements in Control 8.28.

## 8. Tenable.io vulnerability scoring mapping to Jira priorities
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/197722193

This procedure uses Tenable's Vulnerability Priority Rating (VPR) for risk-based vulnerability prioritization, considering exploit probability and impact. It enhances secure coding practices by enabling more effective prioritization of code vulnerabilities based on actual exploitation risk, supporting the continuous improvement aspect of secure coding.
