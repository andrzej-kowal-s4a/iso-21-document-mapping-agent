# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 8.11 Data masking

## 1. Information Classification Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170101881

This policy is directly relevant to data masking control as it establishes the information sensitivity levels (Secret, Private, Restricted, Sensitive, Disclosable) that determine which data requires masking. It provides the framework for identifying sensitive data including PII and customer data that must be protected through data masking techniques in accordance with the control's requirements.

## 2. Personal Data Protection Policy (Polityka Bezpieczeństwa Danych Osobowych)
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170101280

This policy is essential for data masking compliance as it defines comprehensive rules for protecting personal data (PII) including requirements for pseudonymization and anonymization. It addresses data protection processing principles, risk analysis methodology, and technical/organizational measures that directly support the implementation of data masking techniques required by Control 8.11.

## 3. Regulamin ochrony danych osobowych_Rules of personal data protection_BILINGUAL
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170102152

This bilingual procedure provides operational guidelines for protecting personal data, including rules for secure handling of PII in both digital and paper formats. It complements the data masking control by establishing practical rules for data access, password policies, and clean desk practices that ensure masked and sensitive data remains protected throughout its lifecycle.

## 4. Encryption and Cryptography Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170105815

This policy is highly relevant to data masking as it addresses one of the key techniques mentioned in Control 8.11 - encryption as a form of data masking. It defines standards for protecting data at rest and in transit through encryption, cryptographic key management, and approved algorithms, which are essential technical controls that complement data masking implementations.

## 5. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This umbrella policy establishes the overall security framework that supports data masking implementation, including information classification and handling requirements, access management principles based on least privilege, and customer/personal data security provisions. It provides the governance structure that ensures data masking is implemented consistently across the organization.

## 6. Personal Data Protection Breach Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170099350

This procedure is relevant to data masking control as it defines how to respond when data masking or other protective measures fail. It includes breach assessment criteria, notification requirements, and risk evaluation factors that help determine whether data masking techniques were adequate and what additional measures may be needed to protect sensitive data.
