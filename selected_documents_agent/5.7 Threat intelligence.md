# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 5.7 Threat intelligence

## 1. Vulnerability Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/214794244

This policy directly addresses threat intelligence by establishing processes for identifying, evaluating, and treating vulnerabilities - a core component of tactical and operational threat intelligence. It covers vulnerability identification from multiple sources, CVSS scoring frameworks, and treatment strategies that align with the control's requirement to collect and analyze threat information for mitigation actions.

## 2. Security Incident Reporting Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104051

This procedure supports threat intelligence activities by establishing a formal mechanism to report and track security incidents. The information collected through incident reporting feeds into operational threat intelligence, providing details about specific attacks and helping identify emerging threats that could impact the organization.

## 3. Tenable.io vulnerability scoring mapping to Jira priorities
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/197722193

This procedure demonstrates the organization's use of external threat intelligence sources (Tenable.io's Vulnerability Priority Rating) to prioritize vulnerabilities based on exploitation likelihood. The VPR score aggregates multiple threat indicators including exploit availability and industry awareness, providing actionable tactical threat intelligence for preventive controls.

## 4. CVSS score mapping to Jira priorities
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/120783272

This procedure establishes a standardized framework for evaluating and prioritizing vulnerabilities using the CVSS scoring system. It supports the control's requirement for tactical threat intelligence by providing a methodology to understand attacker capabilities and the severity of security weaknesses, enabling informed mitigation decisions.

## 5. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This overarching policy establishes the security framework that supports threat intelligence activities, including requirements for vulnerability testing, monitoring, and response to threats. It mandates regular testing for vulnerabilities and establishes processes for addressing them, which are essential components of implementing threat intelligence into technical controls.

## 6. Risk Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170100789

This policy establishes the risk management framework that threat intelligence feeds into, defining how threat information should be analyzed and used to assess risks. It provides the strategic context for threat intelligence by enabling the organization to understand how identified threats relate to business objectives and determine appropriate mitigation actions.

## 7. Supplier Security Risk Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170099594

This policy supports strategic threat intelligence by addressing supply chain security risks and establishing processes to assess third-party security postures. It demonstrates how threat intelligence about supplier vulnerabilities and security practices is collected, analyzed, and used to make informed decisions about supplier relationships and risk mitigation.
