# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 8.13 Information backup

## 1. S4A Disaster Recovery Plan
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170101158

This document is directly relevant to Control 8.13 as it addresses disaster recovery planning which inherently requires backup and restore capabilities. The plan ensures that adequate backup facilities are in place to enable recovery from loss of data or systems, which is the core purpose of the information backup control.

## 2. Procedure - Service transition to prod
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SUP/pages/160433255

This procedure is highly relevant as it explicitly requires backup/restore procedures to be executed and tested before production deployment. It includes requirements for backup security configuration (including AWS best practices for securing backups), disaster recovery testing, and validation that backups are properly secured with vaults that prevent deletion. These requirements align with the control's guidance on testing backup media and ensuring backup information receives appropriate protection.

## 3. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This umbrella policy establishes requirements for system availability and business continuity, including that contingency plans must be developed and tested periodically. It requires regular testing of backup measures for systems and states that availability of both business-critical corporate data and customer data must be ensured, which directly supports the backup control requirements.

## 4. Change Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104688

This policy is relevant as it governs how changes to systems are managed, including backup-related infrastructure changes. It ensures that any modifications to backup systems or procedures follow proper change control processes, maintaining the integrity and reliability of backup operations across the organization.

## 5. Network General Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104105

This policy requires regular backup of network configurations with frequency and retention established according to service requirements or risk assessment. It mandates that backup copies shall be sufficiently secured, which aligns with Control 8.13's guidance on protecting backup information with appropriate physical and environmental protection consistent with standards applied at the main site.

## 6. Encryption and Cryptography Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170105815

This policy is relevant as it addresses backup protection through encryption. It requires cryptographic keys to be stored in minimal locations needed for proper operation and backups, and mandates effective backup capabilities be available. This supports Control 8.13's guidance on protecting backups by means of encryption according to identified risks, particularly where confidentiality is important.

## 7. Server management procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170107313

This procedure is relevant as it includes specific workflows for backing up server environments before decommissioning, including documenting resources to be backed up and performing backup operations. It demonstrates operational procedures for managing backup copies of systems and ensuring their availability when needed.

## 8. Daily Agreed Procedures document
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CSACAMIG/pages/338363169

This document provides detailed disaster recovery procedures including specific scenarios for database failures and recovery from backups (RDS snapshots). It demonstrates practical implementation of backup and restore procedures, including testing requirements, which aligns with Control 8.13's guidance on regularly testing backup measures to ensure they meet incident response and business continuity objectives.
