# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 5.25 Assessment and decision on information security events

## 1. Security Incident Reporting Procedure / Procedura zgłaszania incydentów związanych z bezpieczeństwem
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104051

This procedure directly addresses the control requirements by establishing a formal process for reporting security incidents, defining what constitutes a security incident, and outlining how events should be assessed and categorized. It includes the process for creating Jira tickets for security incidents and defines responsibilities for the response team (S4A CSIRT) to analyze and categorize reported events.

## 2. Major Incidents
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SUP/pages/160433356

This procedure provides a structured approach to handling major incidents, including assessment criteria, escalation procedures, and decision-making processes. It outlines how to determine incident severity, establish communication channels, and involves the appropriate personnel (Product Owners, Support Managers) in incident assessment and response, which aligns with the control's requirement for proper categorization and prioritization.

## 3. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This umbrella policy establishes the overall security incident management framework and defines security responsibilities across the organization. It includes provisions for security incident management, nonconformity management, and establishes that the organization has a Security Incident Management Plan, which provides the governance structure for assessing and categorizing security events as required by this control.

## 4. Communication procedure in case of Major Incident
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170102638

This procedure supports the control by defining the communication and coordination process during major incidents. It establishes how to assess unplanned downtime or service degradation, when to escalate to appropriate teams, and how to document and communicate incident decisions to stakeholders, ensuring proper incident categorization and coordinated response.

## 5. Tenable.io vulnerability scoring mapping to Jira priorities
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/197722193

This procedure establishes a clear prioritization scheme for vulnerability events based on VPR and CVSS scores, mapping them to Jira priorities (Critical, Major, Minor, Trivial). This directly supports the control's requirement for a categorization and prioritization scheme to identify the consequences and priority of security events related to technical vulnerabilities.

## 6. CVSS score mapping to Jira priorities
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/120783272

This procedure provides a standardized framework for assessing and categorizing vulnerability-related security events based on CVSS severity scores. It establishes clear criteria for determining priority levels and provides examples of what constitutes each severity level, supporting the systematic assessment and decision-making process required by the control.

## 7. Personal Data Protection Breach Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170099350

This procedure addresses the assessment and categorization of information security events specifically related to personal data breaches. It includes detailed risk assessment criteria, decision-making frameworks for determining breach severity (low vs. high risk), and documentation requirements, all of which support the control's requirement for assessing events and deciding if they should be categorized as incidents.
