# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 8.15 Logging

## 1. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This umbrella policy establishes the overall framework for information security management, including requirements for system monitoring, logging, and detection of security events. It requires that systems be monitored for deviations from normal operations and that audit logs be available for inspecting events, which directly supports the logging control requirements for recording and analyzing security-relevant activities.

## 2. New NAGIOS monitoring request procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104450

This procedure establishes the process for implementing monitoring and alerting systems through NAGIOS. It directly addresses the operational aspects of logging by defining what needs to be monitored, monitoring thresholds, reaction times, and responsibility for taking action. The procedure ensures that logs generate alerts and that recorded events are properly analyzed and acted upon, which is essential for the log analysis requirement of Control 8.15.

## 3. Security Incident Reporting Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104051

This procedure is critical for Control 8.15 as it establishes how security incidents identified through log analysis should be reported and managed. Logs record security-relevant events that must be analyzed to identify incidents, and this procedure provides the framework for acting on those findings. It supports the control's purpose of identifying information security events that can lead to incidents and supporting investigations.

## 4. Network General Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104105

This policy directly addresses logging requirements for network infrastructure, mandating that networks have audit logs available for inspecting events such as device access, configuration changes, failed authentication attempts, and security gateway traffic. It requires continuous monitoring covering audit logs from components and alerts, which aligns perfectly with Control 8.15's requirements for recording activities, protecting logs, and analyzing security events.

## 5. Server management procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170107313

This procedure governs the lifecycle management of servers and virtual machines, which are the primary sources of system logs. It ensures proper documentation and tracking of server activities, changes, and configurations throughout their lifecycle. This supports Control 8.15 by establishing accountability for logging infrastructure and ensuring that systems capable of generating and storing logs are properly managed and documented.

## 6. Internal Auditing Policy for Security
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/2086699019

This policy establishes requirements for maintaining documented evidence including logs, records, and audit trails as part of ISMS compliance. It requires sufficient evidence such as logs and record entries related to auditable requirements, and mandates that audit findings be tracked and monitored. This directly supports Control 8.15's requirement for log protection, retention, and analysis to ensure integrity and support investigations.

## 7. Change Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104688

This policy requires that all changes to IT systems be documented and tracked through structured processes. It mandates recording of changes with appropriate documentation, which supports Control 8.15's requirement to log system activities including configuration changes, use of privileges, and system modifications. The policy ensures accountability and traceability of changes that should be captured in logs for security monitoring and incident investigation.
