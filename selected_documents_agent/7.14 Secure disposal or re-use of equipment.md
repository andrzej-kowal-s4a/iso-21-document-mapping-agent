# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 7.14 Secure disposal or re-use of equipment

## 1. Disposal of electronic equipment [#hardware #utilisation] - procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170108048

This procedure directly addresses the control requirements by establishing a formal process for disposing of electronic hardware, including formation of a utilization committee, preparation of protocols, and specific requirements for data storage disposal to prevent data recovery. It references sanitization procedures for devices before disposal or re-use.

## 2. General Information Media Disposal Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104943

This policy provides the overarching framework for disposal and sanitization of media containing sensitive and classified information. It explicitly addresses the control's purpose by ensuring proper disposal methods are followed for hard drives, storage media, and other equipment to prevent information leakage and protect employee and company data.

## 3. Employee Offboarding
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4AIH/pages/149520666

This procedure is highly relevant as it includes comprehensive steps for hardware recovery during employee departure, ensuring equipment is properly collected, checked against assignments, and returned through proper channels. This supports secure disposal or re-use by ensuring all company equipment is accounted for before processing.

## 4. Encryption and Cryptography Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170105815

This policy is relevant to the control's guidance on full-disk encryption as a complementary measure to reduce risk when equipment is disposed of or redeployed. It mandates full disk encryption for all company-owned devices and specifies encryption standards (BitLocker, FileVault2, LUKS), which supports the control's recommendation for using encryption alongside secure deletion.

## 5. Offboarding procedure / Procedura odejścia z firmy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104057

This procedure complements employee offboarding by defining the organizational process for recovering assets when team members depart, including requirements for helpdesk to recover organization assets and revoke access. This ensures equipment containing storage media is properly collected before potential disposal or re-use.

## 6. Information Classification Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170101881

This policy is relevant as it defines the classification levels of information (Secret, Private, Restricted, Sensitive, Disclosable) that must be considered when disposing of or re-using equipment. Understanding information sensitivity levels is crucial for determining appropriate disposal methods and verifying sensitive data removal as required by the control.

## 7. Purchasing Procedure for Standard Hardware
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/1633452033

This procedure addresses the full hardware lifecycle including disposal references. It establishes equipment lifespans, replacement processes, and explicitly references the disposal procedure for unserviceable equipment, supporting the control's requirement for systematic equipment management from acquisition through disposal.

## 8. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This umbrella policy establishes the overall security framework including IT asset management, physical security, and protection of information confidentiality. It provides the foundational requirements that disposal procedures must support, ensuring equipment disposal aligns with broader information security objectives and asset management principles.
