# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 8.25 Secure development life cycle

## 1. Procedure - Service transition to prod
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SUP/pages/160433255

This procedure is essential for Control 8.25 as it addresses the separation of development, test and production environments (8.31) and establishes security checkpoints throughout the deployment process. It includes validation of security requirements, configuration management, testing requirements, and approval processes before production deployment, ensuring security is maintained throughout the development lifecycle.

## 2. Vulnerability Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/214794244

This policy directly supports Control 8.25 by establishing processes for identifying, evaluating, and treating vulnerabilities in software products, systems, and infrastructure. It addresses security testing requirements (8.29) including code scans and the management of security defects discovered during development, which is a core component of secure development practices.

## 3. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This comprehensive policy establishes the foundational security requirements for software systems security, including secure SDLC requirements, secure coding practices, separation of environments, and security by design principles. It directly addresses multiple aspects of Control 8.25 including security in the development lifecycle, security requirements in design phases, and secure repositories.

## 4. Product Development and Support Security Credentials Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106199

This procedure addresses secure handling of security credentials throughout the development lifecycle, supporting Control 8.25 requirements for secure repositories (8.4, 8.9) and security in deployment. It ensures that authentication credentials are not stored in version control systems and that security features are documented and maintained throughout the SDLC.

## 5. Change Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104688

This policy establishes formal change control procedures for all IT systems, directly supporting Control 8.25's requirement for security checkpoints in projects (5.8). It ensures that all changes follow structured processes with proper planning, evaluation, review, approval, and documentation, which are essential for maintaining security in the development lifecycle.

## 6. Procedure -  Deployment Validation Test
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170105878

This procedure supports Control 8.25 by standardizing security and system testing after deployment (8.29). It establishes a consistent approach to validating that deployments meet security requirements and function correctly, which is critical for ensuring security throughout the development and deployment lifecycle.

## 7. CVSS score mapping to Jira priorities
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/120783272

This procedure supports Control 8.25 by establishing a standardized method for evaluating and prioritizing security vulnerabilities discovered during development and testing. It ensures that security defects found during code scans and security testing (8.29) are appropriately assessed and addressed based on their severity.

## 8. Traininig Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106783

This policy addresses Control 8.25's requirement for application security knowledge and training (8.28) by establishing a framework for mandatory and optional training programs. It ensures that developers and team members receive appropriate security training to enhance their capability for preventing, finding, and fixing vulnerabilities during the development lifecycle.
