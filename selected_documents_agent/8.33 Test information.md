# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 8.33 Test information

## 1. Procedure - Service transition to prod
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SUP/pages/160433255

This procedure is highly relevant to Control 8.33 as it addresses the transition of services from testing to production environments. It includes specific requirements for handling test data, data migration procedures, verification of configuration changes, and ensuring test information is properly managed before production deployment. The procedure explicitly covers selective data migration testing and verification of environment configurations.

## 2. Information Classification Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170101881

This policy is essential for Control 8.33 as it defines how sensitive information (including operational data used for testing) should be classified and protected. It establishes data sensitivity levels (Secret, Private, Restricted, Sensitive, Disclosable) and mandates appropriate handling procedures, ensuring that production data copied to test environments receives proper protection as required by the control.

## 3. Personal Data Protection Policy (Polityka Bezpieczeństwa Danych Osobowych)
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170101280

This policy directly supports Control 8.33's requirement that sensitive information, including personally identifiable information (PII), should not be copied into test environments. It establishes comprehensive rules for personal data processing, data minimization principles, and requirements for masking or removing sensitive data, which aligns with the control's guidance on protecting operational information used for testing.

## 4. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This umbrella policy provides overarching security requirements relevant to Control 8.33, including provisions for secure software development lifecycle, separation of development/test/production environments, access control to test systems, and protection of customer and sensitive data. It establishes the framework within which test information must be appropriately selected, protected, and managed.

## 5. Encryption and Cryptography Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170105815

This policy is relevant to Control 8.33 as it ensures that test information containing sensitive data is protected at rest and in transit through encryption. It addresses the security of data storage in test environments and protects operational information copied for testing purposes, ensuring confidentiality as required by the control's guidance on protecting copies of operational information.

## 6. Procedure - Deployment Validation Test
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170105878

This procedure directly relates to Control 8.33 by establishing standardized testing procedures after deployments. It ensures test execution is documented and controlled, supporting the control's objective of ensuring reliability of test results and proper management of test information throughout the testing lifecycle.

## 7. General Information Media Disposal Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104943

This policy addresses Control 8.33's requirement (guidance point e) for properly deleting operational information from test environments after testing is complete. It establishes procedures for secure disposal and sanitization of media containing sensitive test data to prevent unauthorized use of test information.

## 8. Change Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104688

This policy supports Control 8.33 by establishing formal change control procedures that govern how operational data is handled during testing and deployment activities. It ensures that changes involving test information are properly authorized, logged, and reviewed, supporting the control's requirement for separate authorization when operational information is copied to test environments.
