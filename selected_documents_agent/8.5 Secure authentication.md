# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 8.5 Secure authentication

## 1. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This foundational policy establishes the overall framework for information security including access management principles. It defines authentication and authorization processes, mandates unique user identifiers, requires protection of authentication tokens, encourages multi-factor authentication, and implements least privilege principles - all of which are core requirements of the secure authentication control.

## 2. Encryption and Cryptography Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170105815

This policy is critical for secure authentication as it establishes encryption standards for data at rest and in transit, defines cryptographic key management requirements (minimum 128-bit symmetric and 2048-bit asymmetric keys), mandates key rotation intervals, and requires secure storage of SSH private keys - all essential components for implementing secure authentication mechanisms.

## 3. Product Development and Support Security Credentials Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106199

This procedure directly addresses authentication credentials management throughout the software lifecycle. It establishes rules for handling passwords and security credentials, prohibits sharing of accounts, enforces least privilege principles, mandates changing default credentials, and prohibits storing credentials in version control systems - directly supporting secure authentication practices.

## 4. HOW To add SSH key to LDAP
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170105282

This procedure provides specific technical guidance for implementing secure authentication using SSH keys with LDAP integration. It demonstrates the organization's use of cryptographic authentication methods (SSH public keys) as an alternative to passwords, which aligns with the control's guidance on using authentication methods alternative to passwords such as digital certificates.

## 5. Information Technology Acceptable Use Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106001

This policy establishes critical user responsibilities for authentication security, including protecting passwords and security credentials, prohibiting credential sharing, requiring users to log out and lock screens when not in use, and defining acceptable authentication practices - all essential behavioral controls that complement technical authentication mechanisms.

## 6. Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106633

This policy addresses authentication requirements for personal devices accessing corporate resources. It mandates unique PINs/passwords, biometric authentication where available, requires two-factor authentication for remote access, enforces automatic device locking after idle periods, and defines secure remote access authentication methods - directly supporting the control's requirements for multi-factor and strong authentication.

## 7. Offboarding procedure / Procedura odejścia z firmy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104057

This procedure ensures proper termination of authentication privileges when users leave the organization. It includes revoking all access rights, disabling user accounts, recovering authentication tokens, and changing passwords for shared accounts - critical for maintaining authentication security and preventing unauthorized access by former employees.

## 8. Employee Offboarding
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4AIH/pages/149520666

This detailed technical procedure complements the general offboarding procedure by specifying the technical steps to deactivate authentication mechanisms including LDAP accounts, removing users from authentication groups, suspending Google accounts, revoking VPN access, and deactivating accounts across all systems - ensuring comprehensive removal of authentication privileges to prevent unauthorized access.
