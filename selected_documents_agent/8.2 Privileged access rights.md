# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 8.2 Privileged access rights

## 1. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This is the umbrella security policy that directly addresses access management principles including privileged access restrictions. It explicitly states that "Privileged access to any production systems must be restricted" and requires that "User of privileged access shall use them only to perform tasks that require such privileges," which directly supports the control's requirement for restricted and managed privileged access rights.

## 2. Employee Offboarding
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4AIH/pages/149520666

This comprehensive procedure ensures proper revocation of all access rights, including privileged access, when employees leave. It includes deactivation of LDAP accounts, removal from privileged groups (including sudo_appsrv), revocation of system administrator privileges, and removal from various systems and databases. This directly supports control guidance points (c) and (d) regarding authorization processes and privilege expiry.

## 3. Onboarding Procedure / Procedura wdrożenia
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104063

This procedure establishes the formal process for granting initial access rights when new employees join, including assignment to appropriate LDAP groups and privileged groups. It ensures that privileged access is only granted to authorized users with proper authentication through the authorization process, aligning with control guidance points (a), (b), and (c) regarding identification and allocation of privileged access rights.

## 4. Gerrit - access request
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170099777

This procedure defines the formal authorization process for granting privileged access to Gerrit code repositories. It requires manager approval before access is granted and documents all privileges allocated through Jira tickets. The procedure implements specific access levels and uses the "Admins Code Review" group for review, supporting control guidance points (b), (c), and (k) regarding authorization processes, record-keeping, and non-sharing of privileged identities.

## 5. Google accounts howto create
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SUP/pages/496828547

This procedure establishes controlled access to production systems through Google authentication as an identity provider. It defines specific privileged groups (Administrator) and requires that only authorized personnel can create privileged accounts with user_management attributes. This supports control guidance points (b), (c), (f), and (i) regarding allocation, authorization processes, authentication requirements, and temporary access management.

## 6. Server management procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170107313

This procedure controls privileged access to servers and virtual machines through a formal authorization process requiring business justification, admin verification, and CIO approval. It maintains records of server ownership, regular reviews of usage, and defines expiration dates for server access. This supports control guidance points (c), (d), (g), and (j) regarding authorization processes, expiry requirements, regular reviews, and logging.

## 7. Confluence Pages Access Request Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/876347426

This procedure implements a formal request and approval process for access to restricted information in Confluence, particularly for sensitive data like passwords and production credentials. It requires assignment to page owners or authorized personnel for approval and maintains documentation through Jira tickets, supporting control guidance points (b) and (c) regarding privileged access allocation and authorization processes.

## 8. Procedure - Service transition to prod
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SUP/pages/160433255

This comprehensive procedure ensures that privileged access to production environments is properly managed during service transitions. It explicitly requires review and removal of unnecessary database authenticated users, prohibits generic accounts except for break-glass procedures, and ensures only necessary people have privileged access. This directly supports control guidance points (b), (h), (i), and (l) regarding allocation based on minimum requirements, managing generic admin IDs, break-glass procedures, and separation of privileged and normal accounts.
