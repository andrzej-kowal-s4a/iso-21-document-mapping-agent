# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 8.23 Web filtering

## 1. Information Technology Acceptable Use Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106001

This policy directly addresses acceptable use of IT resources including internet access, which is fundamental to web filtering control. It establishes rules for appropriate website access, prohibits accessing obscene or illegal sites, addresses phishing awareness, and defines acceptable vs. unacceptable online behavior - all core requirements of the web filtering control.

## 2. Network General Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104105

This policy includes a dedicated "User Internet Access" section that explicitly addresses web filtering by stating Smart4Aviation reserves the right to introduce internet access limitations that would automatically block websites identified as inappropriate. It also covers anti-malware protection, content filtering, and blocking blacklisted traffic, which are key technical controls for web filtering implementation.

## 3. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This umbrella policy establishes the overall security framework including personnel security awareness training requirements, which supports the control's requirement for training personnel on secure web usage. It also addresses malware protection, system security controls, and the organization's commitment to protecting systems from security threats including those originating from malicious web content.

## 4. Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106633

This policy is relevant because it requires BYOD devices to have content filtering software enabled and configured, addresses the need for anti-malware protection, and prohibits access to inappropriate or malicious websites. Since employees may access web resources from personal devices, this policy ensures web filtering principles extend beyond corporate-managed endpoints.

## 5. Endpoint Software Audit Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/1994686607

This procedure supports web filtering by ensuring endpoint devices have appropriate security software installed and properly configured, including anti-malware and content filtering capabilities. It helps verify that protective mechanisms against malicious web content are in place and functioning on all endpoints, which complements network-level web filtering controls.

## 6. Training Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106783

This policy establishes the framework for mandatory security awareness training for all team members. The control specifically requires training personnel on secure and appropriate use of online resources and the organization's rules regarding web access, making this training policy essential for implementing the human element of web filtering controls.

## 7. Vulnerability Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/214794244

This policy is relevant because web filtering relies on threat intelligence including information about malicious websites, command and control servers, and websites distributing malware. The vulnerability management process helps identify and address security weaknesses that could be exploited through malicious web content, supporting the preventive aspects of web filtering.
