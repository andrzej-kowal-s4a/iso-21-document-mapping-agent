# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 7.9 Security of assets off-premises

## 1. Mobile Device Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106965

This policy directly addresses the protection of mobile devices (smartphones, tablets, laptops) used outside organizational premises. It establishes rules for handling both corporate and private mobile devices, requiring users to maintain control of devices at all times, report loss or theft as security incidents, and implement security configurations including authentication, auto-locking, and protection mechanisms.

## 2. Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106633

This policy governs the use of personal devices for work purposes, which are inherently used off-premises. It addresses authorization requirements, secure remote access methods, prohibition of storing high-sensitivity data on BYOD devices, security incident reporting for lost/stolen devices, and security requirements including encryption, authentication, and physical security measures to prevent unauthorized access.

## 3. Encryption and Cryptography Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170105815

This policy is essential for protecting off-premises assets by requiring full disk encryption for all company-owned devices and personal devices storing company information. It specifies encryption standards (BitLocker, FileVault2, LUKS) for laptops and tablets, mandates encryption of mobile devices containing company data, and addresses data protection both at rest and in transit when devices are used outside secure company networks.

## 4. Hardware insurance list procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4AIH/pages/334365211

This procedure supports the protection of off-premises assets by maintaining an inventory of portable and stationary equipment that requires insurance coverage. It tracks equipment that may be taken off-premises including laptops, tablets, and smartphones, ensuring proper insurance is maintained to protect against loss, damage, or theft as required by the control's guidance on maintaining records of equipment removed from premises.

## 5. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This umbrella policy establishes the overall security framework including physical security requirements, IT asset management, and access management that underpin off-premises asset protection. It mandates protection of IT equipment from security threats and environmental hazards, requires inventory management of hardware assets, and establishes remote access security controls essential for off-premises device usage.

## 6. Endpoint Software Audit Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/1994686607

This procedure ensures that devices used off-premises maintain proper security configurations by conducting periodic software audits. It verifies compliance with approved software lists, detects unauthorized or prohibited software that could compromise off-premises devices, and ensures endpoint security controls remain effective even when devices are not within the organization's direct physical control.

## 7. Employee Offboarding
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4AIH/pages/149520666

This procedure is critical for maintaining chain of custody and protecting off-premises assets during personnel transitions. It includes comprehensive steps for hardware retrieval and verification, deactivation of remote access capabilities, removal of authentication credentials, and ensuring all company equipment taken off-premises is properly accounted for and returned, preventing unauthorized continued access to off-site assets.

## 8. Disposal of electronic equipment [#hardware #utilisation] - procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170108048

This procedure addresses the secure disposal of electronic equipment that may have been used off-premises, ensuring data is properly sanitized before disposal to prevent information compromise. It establishes protocols for destroying data storage devices and maintaining proper documentation of disposal, which is essential for managing the lifecycle of assets that have been used outside organizational premises.
