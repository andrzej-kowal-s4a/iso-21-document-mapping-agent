# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 8.8 Management of technical vulnerabilities

## 1. Vulnerability Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/214794244

This is the primary policy document that directly addresses ISO 27001 Control 8.8. It describes Smart4Aviation's comprehensive approach to vulnerability management, including identifying vulnerabilities across software products, integrated systems, and infrastructure, evaluating them using CVSS scoring, and implementing treatment strategies (remediation, mitigation, acceptance, or rejection). This policy aligns directly with the control's requirements for obtaining information about technical vulnerabilities, evaluating exposure, and taking appropriate measures.

## 2. Tenable.io vulnerability scoring mapping to Jira priorities
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/197722193

This procedure establishes the methodology for prioritizing vulnerabilities identified through Tenable.io scanning based on Vulnerability Priority Rating (VPR) and CVSS scores. It directly supports the control's requirement for evaluating technical vulnerabilities and taking appropriate action based on risk assessment. The document maps vulnerability severity to Jira priorities to ensure timely remediation, with critical vulnerabilities (VPR 9.0-10.0) receiving highest priority.

## 3. CVSS score mapping to Jira priorities
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/120783272

This procedure defines how CVSS v3 vulnerability scores are mapped to internal Jira priority levels, enabling consistent vulnerability risk assessment and prioritization across the organization. It supports the control's guidance on evaluating identified technical vulnerabilities and determining appropriate response timelines, ensuring that high and critical vulnerabilities are addressed first as recommended in the ISO control.

## 4. Endpoint Software Audit Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/1994686607

This procedure implements systematic auditing of software installed on company devices to identify potentially vulnerable, unauthorized, or outdated software that could introduce technical vulnerabilities. It directly supports the control's requirement for maintaining an accurate inventory of assets and identifying technical vulnerabilities through periodic reviews, ensuring compliance with security restrictions and detecting unauthorized software that may contain vulnerabilities.

## 5. Change Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104688

This policy establishes a structured change management process essential for implementing vulnerability patches and updates in a controlled manner. It directly supports ISO 27001 Control 8.8's guidance on addressing technical vulnerabilities through change management procedures (referenced in section 8.32), ensuring that vulnerability remediation activities follow appropriate testing, approval, and documentation processes to minimize risks during patch deployment.

## 6. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This umbrella security policy includes specific requirements for vulnerability management, stating that systems shall be regularly tested for vulnerabilities including source code analysis, third-party module assessment, and penetration testing. It establishes the organizational commitment to identifying and addressing vulnerabilities as part of the overall security management system, supporting the control's requirements for technical vulnerability identification and management processes.

## 7. Server management procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170107313

This procedure manages the lifecycle of server infrastructure including security configuration, monitoring, and decommissioning, which are critical for managing technical vulnerabilities in server environments. It supports the control by ensuring proper configuration management, security reviews, and monitoring of infrastructure assets to identify and address vulnerabilities throughout the server lifecycle, including verification of security configurations before production deployment.

## 8. Procedure - Service transition to prod
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SUP/pages/160433255

This comprehensive procedure includes multiple checkpoints for vulnerability management before transitioning services to production, such as monitoring setup, security hub reviews, vulnerability testing requirements, and patch management verification. It supports the control by ensuring that technical vulnerabilities are identified and remediated before production deployment, including AWS Security Hub checks and requirements for systems to operate without critical issues before go-live.
