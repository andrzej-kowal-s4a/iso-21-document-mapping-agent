# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 8.32 Change management

## 1. Change Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104688

This is the primary policy document that directly addresses ISO 27001 Control 8.32. It defines the formal change management process including change types (standard, normal, emergency), change planning, evaluation, review, approval, communication, implementation, documentation, and post-change review. It comprehensively covers all aspects required by the control including authorization procedures and change control for IT services.

## 2. Procedure - Service transition to prod
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SUP/pages/160433255

This procedure establishes critical controls for transitioning services to production environments, ensuring changes are properly managed, tested, and validated before implementation. It includes Service Acceptance Criteria covering change documentation, testing procedures, deployment validation, and post-implementation monitoring, which directly supports the change management control requirements.

## 3. Procedure: Change to Baseline Management
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106091

This procedure controls subsequent changes to approved baselines through a formal Change Review Board (CRB) process. It ensures impact assessment, proper authorization at appropriate levels, and documented decision-making for changes affecting products, projects, resources, and infrastructure, supporting the authorization and documentation requirements of the control.

## 4. Procedure -  Deployment Validation Test
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170105878

This procedure standardizes testing and validation activities after deployment to customer or suite environments. It ensures that changes are properly tested and documented as required by the control's guidance on testing and acceptance of changes, maintaining the integrity and availability of information systems.

## 5. Procedure: Baseline Management
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104985

This procedure organizes planning of development scope for product versions and controls subsequent baseline changes. It establishes formal approval processes, capacity planning, and scope management that ensure changes follow agreed rules and formal processes as required by the control, particularly for the system development lifecycle.

## 6. Maintenance windows (BT) - working procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170102577

This procedure manages planned maintenance changes through formal block time approvals, ensuring changes are authorized, communicated to relevant parties, properly tested through smoke tests, and include fallback procedures. It directly implements change control procedures for production environments with proper authorization and communication as required by the control.

## 7. Server management procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170107313

This procedure manages the lifecycle of infrastructure changes including server provisioning, modifications, and decommissioning through a formal workflow with approval gates. It ensures infrastructure changes are properly requested, evaluated, authorized, and documented, supporting change management for information processing facilities as required by the control.

## 8. Vulnerability Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/214794244

This policy addresses vulnerability identification, evaluation, and remediation which often requires implementing changes to systems. It ensures security-related changes are properly assessed, prioritized, and managed through formal processes, supporting the preservation of information security during change implementation as required by the control's purpose.
