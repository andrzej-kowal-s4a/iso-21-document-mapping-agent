# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 8.14 Redundancy of information processing facilities

## 1. S4A Disaster Recovery Plan
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170101158

This document directly addresses redundancy and continuity requirements for information processing facilities. It establishes procedures for disaster recovery which is closely related to implementing redundant systems to ensure continuous operation and meet availability requirements as specified in the control.

## 2. Server management procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170107313

This procedure is essential for control 8.14 as it details how virtual machines and server resources are requested, allocated, and managed. It includes processes for resource allocation, environment preparation, and capacity management which are fundamental to implementing and maintaining redundant information processing facilities.

## 3. New NAGIOS monitoring request procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104450

This procedure supports redundancy objectives by establishing monitoring mechanisms that alert the organization to failures in information processing facilities. Such monitoring is explicitly mentioned in the control guidance as necessary to "enable executing the planned procedure and allow continued availability while the information processing facilities are repaired or replaced."

## 4. Procedure - Service transition to prod
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SUP/pages/160433255

This procedure is relevant as it includes requirements for implementing high availability (HA), disaster recovery procedures, redundant systems testing, and load balancing. It specifically addresses monitoring setup, backup/restore procedures, and business continuity planning which are all components of ensuring redundancy meets availability requirements.

## 5. Major Incidents
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SUP/pages/160433356

This procedure is relevant to control 8.14 as it establishes the response process when information processing facilities fail, ensuring continuous operation through incident management. It supports the activation procedures for redundant components mentioned in the control guidance.

## 6. Communication procedure in case of Major Incident
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170102638

This procedure complements redundancy measures by establishing communication protocols during service disruptions or failures. It supports the planned procedures for activating redundant components and ensures stakeholders are informed during failover events to maintain business continuity.

## 7. Change Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104688

This policy is relevant as it governs how changes to IT systems and infrastructure are managed, including modifications to redundant systems and information processing facilities. Proper change management ensures redundancy measures remain effective and don't introduce risks during updates or modifications.

## 8. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This umbrella policy establishes high-level requirements for system availability, business continuity, disaster recovery testing, and resource allocation for systems. It provides the governance framework that supports implementing redundancy measures to meet availability requirements as required by control 8.14.
