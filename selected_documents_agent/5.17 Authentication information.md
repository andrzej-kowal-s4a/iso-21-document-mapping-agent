## 1. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This umbrella policy establishes the foundational requirements for access management and authentication, including provisions for unique identifiers, password protection, multi-factor authentication, and least privilege principles. It directly addresses authentication token management and the requirement to treat authentication information as secret, which are core requirements of Control 5.17.

## 2. Product Development and Support Security Credentials Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106199

This procedure specifically addresses the handling of security credentials (passwords) throughout the software lifecycle, including secure transmission, prohibition of storing credentials in version control, secure channel communication, and changing default credentials. It directly implements the guidance requirements for allocation and management of authentication information outlined in Control 5.17.

## 3. Encryption and Cryptography Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170105815

This policy covers cryptographic key management, password storage and transmission in protected form, rotation requirements, and encryption standards. It directly supports Control 5.17's requirements for protecting authentication information through approved cryptographic techniques and secure storage/transmission of passwords.

## 4. Information Technology Acceptable Use Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106001

This policy establishes user responsibilities for protecting security credentials, including password protection, prohibition of credential sharing, logging out requirements, and phishing awareness. These provisions directly address the user responsibilities section of Control 5.17 regarding appropriate handling of authentication information.

## 5. Onboarding Procedure / Procedura wdrożenia
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104063

This procedure details the allocation of authentication information to new users, including creation of LDAP accounts, issuance of temporary passwords via secure SMS channels, forced password changes on first login, and acknowledgment processes. It implements Control 5.17's guidance on allocation of authentication information and verification of user identity.

## 6. Offboarding procedure / Procedura odejścia z firmy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104057

This procedure addresses the management process for revoking authentication information when employees leave, including recovery of credentials, changing passwords on shared accounts, and removing access privileges. It supports Control 5.17's requirement for controlled management of authentication information throughout the entire lifecycle, including termination.

## 7. Employee Offboarding
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4AIH/pages/149520666

This detailed technical procedure specifies the deactivation of LDAP accounts, removal from authentication groups, suspension of access, password changes in shared accounts, and credential revocation. It provides the operational implementation for authentication information management during employee departure as required by Control 5.17.

## 8. HOW To add SSH key to LDAP
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170105282

This procedure addresses the management of SSH keys (a form of authentication information beyond passwords) including secure generation, storage in LDAP, and proper handling. It demonstrates the organization's management process for cryptographic authentication information as referenced in Control 5.17's guidance on various types of authentication information.
