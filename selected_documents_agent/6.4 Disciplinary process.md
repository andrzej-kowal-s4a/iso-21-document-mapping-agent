# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 6.4 Disciplinary process

## 1. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This is the umbrella security policy that establishes the foundation for all security requirements and responsibilities within the organization. It includes provisions on personnel security, security responsibilities, and nonconformity (noncompliance) management, which are essential prerequisites for implementing a disciplinary process for information security policy violations. The policy defines what violations are and how they should be managed.

## 2. Information Technology Acceptable Use Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106001

This policy clearly defines acceptable and unacceptable behavior regarding the use of IT resources and information assets. It establishes the rules that personnel must follow and explicitly states that "breaching it may result in consequences being drawn," which directly supports the disciplinary process control. This document provides the behavioral standards against which violations can be assessed.

## 3. Security Incident Reporting Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104051

This procedure is essential for identifying and documenting information security policy violations before any disciplinary action can be taken. As the control guidance states, "the disciplinary process should not be initiated without prior verification that an information security policy violation has occurred." This procedure enables that verification process through formal incident reporting and investigation.

## 4. SYGNALISTA: Procedura zgłoszeń wewnętrznych/WHISTLEBLOWER: Internal Reporting Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/1205665906

This procedure establishes a formal internal reporting mechanism for violations and misconduct, including legal violations and information security breaches. It includes provisions for investigating reported violations, taking follow-up actions (including disciplinary measures), and protecting whistleblowers from retaliation. The procedure outlines graduated responses based on investigation findings, which aligns with the control's requirement for a graduated disciplinary approach.

## 5. Offboarding procedure / Procedura odejścia z firmy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104057

This procedure is relevant to the disciplinary process as it describes how the organization handles personnel departure, which may result from serious information security violations requiring termination. The procedure ensures that access rights are revoked, assets are recovered, and knowledge is transferred in an organized manner when employment relationships end, whether voluntarily or through dismissal.

## 6. Training Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106790

This procedure supports the disciplinary process by ensuring personnel receive proper security awareness training. The control guidance states that disciplinary responses should consider "whether or not the violator was properly trained." This procedure, linked with the Training Policy, documents the organization's training program and helps determine if personnel had adequate knowledge of security requirements before violations occurred.

## 7. Personnel Vetting Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104805

This policy establishes workforce suitability determinations for positions requiring access to high confidentiality information, helping prevent security violations before they occur. It supports the overall human resource security framework within which the disciplinary process operates, ensuring that personnel with security responsibilities are properly vetted and verified before being granted access.
