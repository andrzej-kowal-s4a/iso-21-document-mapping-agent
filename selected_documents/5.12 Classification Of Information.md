**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170101881

This is the most directly relevant document as it comprehensively establishes the organization's information classification scheme. It defines five sensitivity levels (Secret, Private, Restricted, Sensitive, Disclosable) with clear definitions, handling rules, and intended target personnel for each level. The policy addresses confidentiality, integrity, and availability requirements, includes criteria for classification based on business impact, and provides detailed mapping of information categories to sensitivity levels across organizational units. It establishes that information owners are accountable for classification and ensures consistency across the organization, directly aligning with ISO 27001 control 5.12 requirements.

## 2. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This policy is relevant because it establishes the overall information security framework and references the Information Classification Policy. It defines security objectives including safeguarding customer, corporate, and employee data from unauthorized disclosure, which requires proper information classification. The policy establishes security responsibilities and provides the organizational context within which the classification scheme operates. It ensures that classification is integrated into the broader information security management system and that all personnel understand their responsibilities regarding classified information.

## 3. Mobile Device Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106965

This policy is relevant because it demonstrates how the information classification scheme is applied in practice. It references the Information Classification Policy and specifies handling requirements based on classification levels (e.g., no Secret or Restricted data shall be stored on mobile devices except under specific conditions). The policy shows how classification levels inform protection requirements and access controls, demonstrating that the classification scheme is consistently applied across different types of assets and use cases. It ensures that classification drives appropriate security controls.

## 4. Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106633

This policy is relevant because it references the Information Classification Policy and applies classification requirements to personal devices used for work. It ensures that the classification scheme is consistently applied regardless of device ownership, demonstrating that classification is organization-wide and not limited to corporate assets. The policy shows how classification informs security controls for BYOD scenarios, ensuring that information is protected according to its classification level even when accessed from personal devices. This demonstrates the practical application and enforcement of the classification scheme.
