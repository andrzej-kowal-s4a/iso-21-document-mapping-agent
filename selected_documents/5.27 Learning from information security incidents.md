# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 5.27 Learning from information security incidents

## 1. Major Incidents
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SUP/pages/160433356

This procedure is highly relevant as it mandates Root Cause Analysis (RCA) for major incidents, which directly addresses the control requirement for post-incident analysis to identify root causes. The procedure requires that RCA is performed as soon as possible after incidents, establishes dedicated channels for analysis, and includes rules for managing incidents and root cause analysis. This ensures that knowledge gained from incidents is captured and can be used to strengthen controls, addressing requirement (i) of the control.

## 2. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This policy is directly relevant because it explicitly commits to continuous improvement and states that Smart4Aviation Group will "incorporate lessons learned from security incidents and audit findings" into the ISMS. The policy also requires that security risk assessments are carried out "in response to significant security incidents," which addresses requirement (b) for identifying recurring or serious incidents and updating risk assessments. The continuous improvement commitment ensures that incident knowledge is used to enhance security controls.

## 3. Personal Data Protection Breach Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170099350

This procedure is relevant because it explicitly requires "ensuring learning from breaches and implementing breach prevention controls as lessons learned." It establishes procedures for documenting breaches, assessing risks, and managing breach response, which creates a framework for capturing knowledge from incidents. The procedure ensures that personal data breaches are treated as security incidents and that lessons learned are applied to prevent future similar incidents, directly supporting requirement (b) for identifying causes and implementing additional controls.

## 4. Policy Owner vs Author of procedures, standards, guidances and processes.
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170102632

This policy establishes the review cycle for policies and procedures, which includes sample review questions such as "Has a compliance violation or incident occurred?" and "What are risks in the company that can illuminate any needed changes in current policy or the need for new policies?" This ensures that incidents are considered during policy reviews and that policies are updated based on lessons learned. The policy requires ongoing measurement and reporting of outcomes, including issues of non-compliance, which supports requirement (a) for enhancing the incident management plan based on incident knowledge.

## 5. Risk Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170100789

This policy is relevant because it establishes the framework for risk identification, analysis, and management, including regular monitoring and review of risks. The policy requires that risk information is regularly monitored and reviewed to ensure currency, and that risk owners have responsibilities to review and update risks. This supports requirement (b) for updating the organization's information security risk assessment based on incident knowledge. The policy also requires risk response planning which involves improving existing controls and implementing additional controls, directly addressing the control's purpose of reducing likelihood or consequences of future incidents.
