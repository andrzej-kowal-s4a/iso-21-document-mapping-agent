**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170101280

This policy is highly relevant as it directly addresses legal and regulatory requirements, specifically GDPR compliance. The policy explicitly states its objective to "ensure legal compliance, in particular compliance with the GDPR" and defines the approach to meet these requirements. It includes provisions for cross-border data transfers, addressing requirement (b) for considering compliance in all relevant countries when transferring information across jurisdictional borders. The policy establishes the Data Protection Officer role and defines processes and responsibilities to meet legal requirements, addressing requirement (d) for defining and documenting specific processes and individual responsibilities.

## 2. Supplier Security Risk Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170099594

This policy is directly relevant because it addresses contractual requirements related to information security, specifically contracts with suppliers. The policy establishes processes for evaluating supplier contracts and requires that contracts include appropriate security provisions, including Data Processing Agreements (DPA) when suppliers handle personal data. It addresses requirement (f) for determining suppliers' contractual requirements relevant to the organization. The policy also requires Legal Team to verify and negotiate contractual provisions, ensuring that supplier agreements include necessary information security requirements, directly supporting the control requirement for identifying and documenting contractual requirements.

## 3. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This policy is relevant because it explicitly states the responsibility to "comply with privacy and personal data processing requirements" and mentions that security requirements may be exceeded "due to specific business needs or specific legal or regulatory requirements." The policy establishes the overall framework for considering legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements when developing information security policies and procedures, addressing requirement (a) of the control. It also references GDPR and links to privacy-related policies, ensuring that legal requirements are integrated into the information security management approach.

## 4. Information Classification Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170101881

This policy is relevant because it explicitly states one of its objectives is "To comply with industry standards, Smart4Aviation Group Customers' requirements regarding confidentiality and legal requirements (e.g. GDPR)." The policy addresses requirement (c) for classifying information and other associated assets as part of the process for setting information security requirements, taking into account legal requirements. It establishes that personal data shall be treated at least as Private level and references GDPR and Personal Data Protection Policy, ensuring that legal requirements are considered when classifying information and setting security requirements.

## 5. Encryption and Cryptography Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170105815

This policy is relevant because cryptography is an area that often has specific legal requirements, as mentioned in the control guidance. The policy establishes standards for encryption and cryptography use, which must comply with legal requirements. While the policy itself may not explicitly detail all legal requirements, it establishes the framework for managing cryptography in compliance with legal, statutory and regulatory requirements. This addresses the control requirement for identifying and documenting legal requirements related to cryptography, including restrictions on import/export and usage of cryptographic functions.
