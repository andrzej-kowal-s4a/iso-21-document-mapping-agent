# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 6.1 Screening

## 1. Personnel Vetting Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104805

This is the most directly relevant document as it comprehensively covers all aspects of personnel screening including identity verification, criminal background checks, employment reference checks, and social media screening. The policy explicitly addresses verification procedures for candidates and employees, compliance with applicable laws (GDPR, Polish labor law), and defines who is eligible to perform identity verification. It aligns perfectly with ISO 27001 control 6.1 requirements for background verification checks prior to joining and ongoing verification.

## 2. Onboarding Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104063

This procedure is highly relevant as it includes identity verification as a mandatory step during the onboarding process. It specifies that employee identity verification must be performed on the first day by checking ID cards, and this verification must occur before granting permissions to work with information above Disclosable sensitivity level. The procedure covers all types of personnel (full-time, part-time, contractors, B2B) which aligns with the ISO control requirement for screening all candidates.

## 3. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This policy is relevant because it establishes the requirement for "workforce suitability determinations" for positions requiring access to high confidentiality information, unless prohibited by law. It also covers access management principles including that access privileges are granted based on job responsibilities and that user identity must be verified before authorization. The policy's Personnel Security section directly supports the screening control by requiring suitability determinations for critical roles.

## 4. Supplier Security Risk Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170099594

This policy is relevant because ISO 27001 control 6.1 specifically requires that screening requirements be included in contractual agreements with suppliers when personnel are contracted through service providers. This policy addresses supplier security requirements and contractual security clauses, which would include personnel screening requirements for supplier-provided personnel. It ensures that third-party contractors and subcontractors are subject to appropriate security vetting.

## 5. Rules of Personal Data Protection
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170102152

This document is relevant because it establishes the access management procedures that are implemented after screening is completed. It specifies that individual user IDs are granted at the moment cooperation begins (contract of employment or civil-legal agreement), and that accounts are managed by IT Administrators with authorizations granted based on business role. The document ensures that the screening process is properly followed by access control procedures, verifying that only screened and authorized personnel receive system access.
