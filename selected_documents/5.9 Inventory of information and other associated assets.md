This overarching policy explicitly requires Smart4Aviation Group to maintain inventory of its hardware and software assets at an appropriate level of granularity for tracking and reporting. It mandates that IT assets be assigned to designated departments and that inventories be created and maintained automatically where technically feasible, directly supporting ISO 27001 Control 5.9 requirements for developing and maintaining an inventory of information and other associated assets.

## 2. Information Classification Policy

This policy supports Control 5.9 by establishing how information assets should be classified based on confidentiality, integrity, and availability levels. It mandates that information and information-processing assets have designated owners and provides detailed classification schemas, which directly supports the control's requirement that assets be classified according to information classification and have assigned ownership. The policy ensures that each asset is classified in accordance with the classification of the information associated to that asset.

## 3. Server management procedure

This comprehensive procedure manages the entire lifecycle of virtual machine and server assets from creation through decommissioning. It establishes processes for documenting server specifications, ownership, business justification, and expiration dates, supporting the control's requirements for maintaining accurate inventories of infrastructure assets with clear ownership and lifecycle management. The procedure ensures that asset ownership is assigned when assets are created and reassigned as necessary.

## 4. Hardware insurance list procedure

This procedure directly addresses hardware asset inventory management by establishing a process to maintain lists of company-owned equipment that must be insured. It ensures that hardware assets are tracked with their location (KRK/GDN offices), gross replacement amounts, ID numbers, and production years, supporting the control's requirement for accurate and up-to-date asset inventories with location information. The procedure includes regular review processes to ensure accuracy of the inventory.

## 5. Endpoint Software Audit Procedure

This procedure establishes systematic auditing of software installed on company devices, directly supporting the requirement to maintain inventories of software assets. It provides a monthly review process to ensure accurate tracking of software on endpoints, which is essential for maintaining an up-to-date software asset inventory and ensuring proper asset classification and ownership. The procedure ensures regular reviews of identified assets against the asset inventory as required by Control 5.9.
