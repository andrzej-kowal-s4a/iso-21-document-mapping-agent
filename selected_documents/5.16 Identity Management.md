This policy is highly relevant as it establishes identity verification procedures that are fundamental to identity management. It requires identity verification to be performed prior to granting permissions to work with information above Disclosable sensitivity level, specifies procedures for verifying identity-proving documents (both in person and online), and ensures that a specific identity is linked to a single person. The policy addresses the control's requirement for verifying the identity of an entity before allocating them a logical identity and ensuring that identities assigned to persons are uniquely linked to individuals.

## 2. Onboarding Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104063

This procedure is highly relevant as it establishes the process for creating and configuring identities for new employees, contractors, and other team members. It includes detailed steps for creating LDAP accounts, Google Workspace accounts, Jira accounts, and other system identities, and specifies that identity verification must be performed on the first day. The procedure covers the full lifecycle of identity establishment from pre-arrival through onboarding, addressing the control's requirements for establishing identities, configuring and activating identities, and ensuring proper identity setup.

## 3. Rules of Personal Data Protection
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170102152

It specifies that accounts are managed by IT Administrators, prohibits work on another user's account, restricts use of common accounts except where technically impossible, and addresses identity-related security practices. The document supports the control's requirements for managing the full lifecycle of identities and ensuring unique identification of individuals accessing information systems.

## 4. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This policy is relevant as it establishes the overall framework for identity and access management, requiring that access to IT systems be provided through individually assigned unique identifiers (User ID) with authentication tokens. It specifies that user identity must be verified before authorization, addresses the need for processes to ensure that prior to employee separation accounts are disabled and access rights removed, and establishes the foundation for identity management practices. The policy provides the organizational context within which identity management procedures operate.
