# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 5.13 Labelling of Information

## 1. Information Classification Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170101881

This is the most directly relevant document as it establishes the information classification scheme with five sensitivity levels (Secret, Private, Restricted, Sensitive, Disclosable) that form the foundation for information labelling. The policy defines rules of handling for each classification level and maps information categories to their default sensitivity levels, which directly supports the ISO control requirement for developing procedures for information labelling in accordance with the organization's classification scheme.

## 2. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This umbrella policy is highly relevant because it establishes the requirement that any information shall be classified based on its confidentiality, integrity and availability, and must be handled securely in accordance with its confidentiality level. The policy's Information Classification and Handling section provides the framework that labelling procedures must support, ensuring that classification labels facilitate proper handling of information according to its sensitivity.

## 3. Rules of Personal Data Protection
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170102152

This procedure is relevant because it establishes practical handling requirements for classified information, including rules for paper documents with personal data and secure handling of information based on classification levels. The document demonstrates how classification labels translate into operational procedures for information handling, which aligns with the ISO control's requirement that labelling should support automation of information processing and management.

## 4. Encryption and Cryptography Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170105815

This policy is relevant because it references information classification levels (Secret, Restricted, Sensitive) and establishes encryption requirements based on classification. The policy demonstrates how classification labels are used to determine appropriate security controls, showing that labels enable systems to make decisions based on associated classification, which is a key requirement of the ISO control for metadata and automated processing.

## 5. Mobile Device Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106965

This policy is relevant because it explicitly references the Information Classification Policy and establishes rules for handling information based on classification levels on mobile devices. The policy requires that users be aware of what kind of data they keep on devices and handle it according to classification, demonstrating how classification labels guide information handling across different formats and storage media, which aligns with the ISO control requirement for labelling information in all formats.
