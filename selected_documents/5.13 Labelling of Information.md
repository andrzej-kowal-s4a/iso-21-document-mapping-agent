# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 5.13 Labelling of Information

## 1. Information Classification Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170101881

This policy is highly relevant as it establishes the information classification scheme that labelling procedures would support. While it doesn't explicitly detail labelling techniques, it defines the sensitivity levels (Secret, Private, Restricted, Sensitive, Disclosable) that would need to be communicated through labels. The policy establishes the foundation for information classification that labelling procedures must reflect, ensuring that classification labels are consistent across the organization. It also references that information should be handled according to its sensitivity level, which requires proper labelling to facilitate correct handling.

## 2. Policy Owner vs Author of procedures, standards, guidances and processes.
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170102632

This document is relevant because it establishes requirements for document metadata and labelling. It explicitly states that "Documents must include metadata (data about the document) that complies with company standards" and requires that "relevant labeling of the document is in place" when creating policies, procedures, standards and guidance. This demonstrates that the organization has procedures for attaching metadata to documents, which is one of the labelling techniques mentioned in ISO 27001 control 5.13. The document ensures consistency in how documents are marked and identified across the organization.

## 3. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This policy is relevant as it acts as the umbrella document for all security policies and establishes the overall framework for information security management. It references the Information Classification Policy and establishes security responsibilities that would include ensuring information is properly classified and labelled. The policy's focus on protecting confidentiality, integrity and availability of information requires that information be properly marked and labelled so personnel can apply appropriate protection measures. It provides the organizational context within which labelling procedures operate.
