## 1. S4A Disaster Recovery Plan
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170101158

This is the primary ICT continuity plan document that establishes the framework for ICT readiness for business continuity. The plan includes links to DR details for individual services and provides the organizational structure for planning, implementing, maintaining and testing ICT readiness based on business continuity objectives. It addresses requirement (a) for an adequate organizational structure to prepare for, mitigate and respond to disruptions, and requirement (b) for ICT continuity plans with response and recovery procedures.

## 2. Daily Agreed Procedures document
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CSACAMIG/pages/338363169

This document is highly relevant as it contains detailed ICT continuity plans including response and recovery procedures for various failure scenarios. It establishes Response Times and Resolution Times (which relate to Recovery Time Objectives - RTO) for different priority levels, with Blocker issues requiring 5-minute response and 4-hour resolution. The document specifies System Availability of 99.95% and includes comprehensive Disaster Recovery Procedures for EC2 servers, RDS databases, regions/VPCs, and total disaster scenarios. It addresses requirement (c) for ICT continuity plans to include RTO of prioritized ICT services and procedures for restoring components, as well as performance and capacity specifications through availability requirements.

## 3. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This policy is relevant because it explicitly includes "Ensure system availability and service continuity" as a security objective, stating the goal to "ensure the operational robustness of all customer-facing services by effectively managing security risks, maintaining uptime in line with contractual SLAs, and ensuring business continuity capabilities meet defined recovery objectives." The policy requires that "System availability-related procedures such as customer service disaster recovery shall be periodically tested" and that "Contingency plans shall be developed for both customer software and internal Smart4Aviation Group software. Such plans (disaster recovery plan, business continuity plan) shall be tested periodically." This addresses requirement (b) for ICT continuity plans to be regularly evaluated through exercises and tests.

## 4. Communication procedure in case of Major Incident
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170102638

This procedure is relevant because it establishes ICT continuity response and recovery procedures for managing ICT service disruptions. It includes procedures for performing fixing/recovery activities, restoring services, and ensuring service restoration is validated. The procedure addresses requirement (b) for ICT continuity plans including response and recovery procedures detailing how the organization plans to manage an ICT service disruption. It ensures that recovery activities are coordinated and that services are restored within required timeframes, supporting the RTO requirements established in ICT continuity plans.

## 5. Major Incidents
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SUP/pages/160433356

This procedure is relevant because it establishes the organizational structure and processes for managing major incidents that cause ICT service disruptions. It defines responsibilities, escalation procedures, and coordination mechanisms for responding to disruptions. The procedure ensures that personnel with necessary responsibility, authority and competence are involved in incident response, addressing requirement (a) for an adequate organizational structure to prepare for, mitigate and respond to disruptions. It also establishes procedures for incident resolution and recovery activities that support ICT continuity objectives.
