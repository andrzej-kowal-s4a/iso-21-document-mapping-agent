# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 7.11 Supporting utilities

## 1. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This policy is directly relevant as it establishes the Physical Security section requiring that information processing and storage facilities have defined security perimeters, appropriate security barriers and access controls. It also mandates that all IT equipment and storage devices be protected from security threats and environmental hazards to ensure confidentiality, integrity and availability. The policy's requirement for system availability and service continuity procedures directly supports protection against utility failures and disruptions.

## 2. Network General Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104105

This policy is highly relevant because it requires network infrastructure devices to have restricted physical access (e.g., in locked storage or protected server rooms) and mandates monitoring to detect hardware failures. The document specifies that devices must be monitored using SNMP or similar means to detect events such as hardware failures, which aligns with the ISO control requirement for alarms to detect utility malfunctions. The policy also addresses network segmentation and separation, which relates to the control requirement for utility equipment to be on separate networks.

## 3. S4A Disaster Recovery Plan
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170101158

This document is critical for supporting utilities control as it establishes disaster recovery procedures to address service disruptions and outages, including those caused by utility failures. The plan ensures business continuity capabilities and recovery objectives are met, directly supporting the ISO control's purpose of preventing interruption to operations due to failure and disruption of supporting utilities. It provides the framework for responding to infrastructure failures that could result from utility disruptions.

## 4. Daily Agreed Procedures document
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CSACAMIG/pages/338363169

This document is relevant because it contains detailed disaster recovery procedures for various infrastructure failure scenarios including region/VPC failures, internet gateway failures, and total disaster scenarios. It establishes procedures for service recovery and includes RACI matrices defining responsibilities for infrastructure management, monitoring, and incident response. The document addresses how to handle outages and disruptions, which directly relates to protecting information processing facilities from utility failures and ensuring service continuity.

## 5. Communication procedure in case of Major Incident
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170102638

This procedure is relevant because ISO 27001 control 7.11 requires emergency communications to be provided. This document establishes the communication process for major incidents including unplanned downtime or service degradation, which would include incidents caused by utility failures. It defines emergency communication channels, notification procedures, and escalation processes, ensuring that personnel have access to emergency contact details and communication mechanisms during outages, as required by the ISO control.
