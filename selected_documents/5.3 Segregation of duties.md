# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 5.3 Segregation of duties

## 1. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This policy contains a dedicated "Separation of Duties" section that explicitly requires segregation of duties to reduce risk of accidental or deliberate system misuse. It mandates that when segregation is not technically feasible, compensatory controls such as monitoring, logging/auditing, and supervision must be implemented. The policy also includes access management principles requiring role-based authorization and least privilege, directly addressing ISO 27001 control 5.3 requirements for segregating conflicting duties and responsibilities.

## 2. Rules of personal data protection (Regulamin ochrony danych osobowych)
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170102152

This procedure implements segregation of duties in access management by requiring individual user IDs for authentication and authorization, prohibiting shared accounts, and mandating that accounts are managed by IT Administrators with authorizations granted based on business roles. The procedure separates the roles of requesting access, approving access, and implementing access rights - one of the key segregation examples mentioned in ISO 27001 control 5.3. It ensures that access privileges are granted based on job responsibilities and limited to necessary tasks.

## 3. Procedure: Change to Baseline Management
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106091

This procedure demonstrates segregation of duties in change management by separating the roles of initiating changes (CRB Requestor), approving changes (CEO, CIO, CFO, Directors), and executing changes (implementation teams). The procedure defines distinct roles and responsibilities, with approval hierarchies that prevent a single individual from initiating, approving, and executing changes independently. This directly addresses ISO 27001 control 5.3 requirement for segregating activities such as initiating, approving and executing a change.

## 4. Information Classification Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170101881

This policy supports segregation of duties by defining information sensitivity levels and access restrictions based on roles and need-to-know principles. It establishes that access to information is restricted based on organizational roles (C-level management, Management, Specialists) and legitimate business purposes, ensuring that individuals only have access to information necessary for their duties. The policy helps prevent conflicts by clearly defining who should have access to what information based on their role and responsibilities, supporting the segregation of duties principle.
