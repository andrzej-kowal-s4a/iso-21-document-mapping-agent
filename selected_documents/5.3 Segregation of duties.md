# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 5.3 Segregation of duties

## 1. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This policy contains a dedicated "Separation of Duties" section that explicitly states separation of duties shall be implemented where appropriate to reduce risk of accidental or deliberate system misuse. It also addresses access management principles including role-based authorization, process for application and approval of privileges, and least privilege principle. The policy establishes that when segregation is not feasible, compensatory controls such as monitoring, logging/auditing, and supervision should be implemented, directly aligning with ISO 27001 control 5.3 requirements.

## 2. Regulamin ochrony danych osobowych_Rules of personal data protection_BILINGUAL
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170102152

This procedure establishes access management controls that implement segregation of duties principles. It specifies that each user must have an individual identifier, accounts are managed by IT Administrators while authorizations are granted based on business role by supervisors, prohibiting work on another user's account and use of shared accounts. The procedure ensures that the process of requesting, approving, and implementing access rights is segregated between different roles (IT Administrators and supervisors), directly supporting ISO 27001 control 5.3 requirement for segregating conflicting duties such as requesting, approving and implementing access rights.

## 3. Onboarding Procedure / Procedura wdrożenia
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104063

This procedure demonstrates segregation of duties in the access rights assignment process during employee onboarding. It shows that HR Team Members, Helpdesk staff, and Managers have distinct responsibilities in the access provisioning process - HR handles identity verification and account creation requests, Helpdesk creates technical accounts and assigns groups, while Managers assign business roles and tasks. This separation ensures that no single individual can both request and approve access rights, supporting ISO 27001 control 5.3 requirement for segregating requesting, approving and implementing access rights.

## 4. Offboarding procedure / Procedura odejścia z firmy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104057

This procedure ensures proper segregation when revoking access rights during employee separation. It specifies that Helpdesk is responsible for revoking organization privileges and access, while HR handles finalization of employment details, and Managers coordinate knowledge transfer. The procedure ensures that access revocation is performed by different personnel than those who granted access, and that the process involves multiple roles (HR, Helpdesk, Manager) with distinct responsibilities, supporting ISO 27001 control 5.3 requirement for segregating conflicting duties.

## 5. Procedure: Change to Baseline Management
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106091

This procedure demonstrates segregation of duties in the change management process, which is one of the examples mentioned in ISO 27001 control 5.3 (initiating, approving and executing a change). It establishes that Change Requestors, CRB Moderators, and approvers (CEO, CIO, CFO, Directors) have distinct roles, with approval hierarchy ensuring that those who initiate changes cannot approve them at the same level. The procedure ensures that initiating, approving, and executing changes are separated between different individuals, directly supporting ISO 27001 control 5.3 requirements.

## 6. Internal Auditing Policy for Security
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/2086699019

This policy addresses segregation of duties in the auditing context, which is another example mentioned in ISO 27001 control 5.3 (designing, auditing and assuring information security controls). It explicitly requires that auditors must not audit their own work and must be selected to ensure objectivity and impartiality. The policy ensures that those who design and implement security controls are not the same individuals who audit and assure them, directly supporting ISO 27001 control 5.3 requirement for segregating conflicting duties in security control assurance.
