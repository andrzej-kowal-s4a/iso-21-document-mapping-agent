# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 5.29 Information security during disruption

## 1. S4A Disaster Recovery Plan
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170101158

This is the primary document directly addressing disaster recovery and maintaining operations during disruptions. The plan establishes procedures for disaster scenarios and includes links to DR details for individual services. It provides the framework for planning how to maintain information security during disruptions, addressing the control requirement for developing, implementing, testing, reviewing and evaluating plans to maintain or restore security of information for critical business processes following interruption or failure.

## 2. Service Agreement - Disaster Recovery Procedures
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SUP/pages/338363169

This document is highly relevant as it contains detailed disaster recovery procedures for various failure scenarios including EC2 server failures, RDS database failures, region/VPC failures, and total disaster scenarios. It establishes specific recovery steps for each type of disruption, including procedures for switching services to DR regions, recovering from snapshots, and restoring services. The document addresses requirement (a) for implementing information security controls within ICT continuity plans and requirement (b) for processes to maintain existing security controls during disruption, as it includes procedures for maintaining confidentiality of diagnostic data and ensuring proper security during recovery activities.

## 3. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This policy is relevant because it explicitly includes "Ensure system availability and service continuity" as a security objective, stating the goal to "ensure the operational robustness of all customer-facing services by effectively managing security risks, maintaining uptime in line with contractual SLAs, and ensuring business continuity capabilities meet defined recovery objectives." The policy establishes the overall framework for including information security requirements in business continuity management processes, addressing the control requirement for determining requirements for adapting information security controls during disruption and including information security in business continuity management.

## 4. Communication procedure in case of Major Incident
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170102638

This procedure is relevant because it establishes processes for handling major incidents which often involve service disruptions. It includes procedures for performing fixing/recovery activities, restoring services, and ensuring service restoration is validated. The procedure addresses maintaining security during disruption by establishing communication channels and recovery processes that ensure information security is maintained throughout the incident response. It supports requirement (b) for processes to maintain existing information security controls during disruption by ensuring proper coordination and security-aware recovery activities.

## 5. Major Incidents
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SUP/pages/160433356

This procedure is relevant because it establishes the framework for managing major incidents that cause service disruptions. It includes procedures for incident resolution, coordination with responsible parties, and ensuring proper handling of incidents. The procedure ensures that security considerations are maintained during incident response and recovery activities. It addresses the control requirement for maintaining information security during disruption by establishing structured processes for incident management that include security considerations, supporting requirement (b) for processes to maintain existing information security controls during disruption.
