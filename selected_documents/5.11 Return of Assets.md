## 1. Employee Offboarding
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4AIH/pages/149520666

This procedure is directly relevant as it comprehensively covers the recovery of organization assets during employee offboarding. It specifically includes task #6 "Hardware" which details the process of taking and checking employee hardware, verifying hardware assignments in Jira, and returning hardware items. The procedure ensures that all physical assets (laptops, devices, equipment) are properly recovered and documented when an employee's contract ends, aligning with ISO 27001 control 5.11 requirements for returning all organization assets upon termination.

## 2. Offboarding procedure / Procedura odejścia z firmy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104057

This procedure is highly relevant as it formalizes the offboarding process including asset recovery. It explicitly states that Helpdesk should "Recover organization assets and perform other offboarding activities" on the last working day of an employee. The procedure also covers knowledge transfer and ensures that all files, documents, and information that the departing team member must hand over are properly identified and transferred, which supports the control's requirement to document and transfer important information before asset return.

## 3. Disposal of electronic equipment [#hardware #utilisation] - procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170108048

This procedure is relevant because it addresses what happens to assets after they are returned, particularly for equipment that contains data storage. The procedure requires that hardware with data storage (like hard drives) must be destroyed before utilization to prevent data recovery, which aligns with ISO 27001 control 5.11 guidance about securely deleting information from equipment. It ensures that returned assets containing sensitive information are properly sanitized before disposal or reuse.

## 4. General Information Media Disposal Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104943

This policy is relevant because it establishes requirements for proper disposal and sanitization of media and equipment that process, store, or transmit classified and sensitive data. The policy ensures that media cannot be released from Smart4Aviation's control until equipment has been sanitized and all stored information cleared, which directly supports the asset return control's requirement to securely handle information on returned assets. It complements the offboarding procedures by providing the policy framework for secure asset disposal.
