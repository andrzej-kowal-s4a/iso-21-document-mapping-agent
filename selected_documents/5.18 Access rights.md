# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 5.18 Access rights

## 1. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This is the most directly relevant document as it establishes the fundamental access management framework required by control 5.18. The policy defines access management principles including unique user identifiers, authorization processes, role-based access control, privileged access management, and least privilege principle. It explicitly requires a process for application and approval of access privileges, and mandates that access rights be removed prior to employee separation, directly addressing the control's requirements for provisioning, review, modification and removal of access rights.

## 2. Employee Offboarding
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4AIH/pages/149520666

This procedure is highly relevant as it comprehensively addresses the control requirement for timely removal of access rights when employees leave the organization. The document details systematic removal of logical and physical access rights across multiple systems (LDAP, Google, Jira, Slack, AWS, VPN, hardware, licenses) and includes steps for revoking customer grants and reassigning responsibilities. It ensures access rights are removed on the first business day after contract termination, directly supporting the control's requirement for timely access revocation.

## 3. Rules of Personal Data Protection
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170102152

This document is relevant because it establishes the access management procedures for work commencement, suspension and termination, which aligns with control 5.18's requirements for provisioning and revocation of access rights. It specifies that individual user identifiers are granted at the moment cooperation begins, accounts are managed by IT Administrators, and authorizations are granted based on business roles. The document also covers procedures for access removal during work termination, ensuring proper access rights lifecycle management.

## 4. Gerrit - access request
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170099777

This procedure demonstrates the access provisioning process with proper authorization workflows, which directly supports control 5.18's requirement for obtaining authorization before granting access rights. The document establishes a formal access request process requiring manager approval (Acceptor field), documentation of access path and access level, and separation between approval and implementation roles. It shows how access rights are provisioned only after authorization procedures are successfully completed, maintaining records of access rights granted.

## 5. Onboarding Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104063

This procedure is relevant because it covers the initial provisioning of access rights when employees join the organization, which is the starting point of the access rights lifecycle management required by control 5.18. The document ensures that new employees receive appropriate access based on their role and responsibilities during the onboarding process, establishing the foundation for proper access management. It works in conjunction with the offboarding procedure to ensure complete lifecycle management of access rights from provisioning to revocation.
