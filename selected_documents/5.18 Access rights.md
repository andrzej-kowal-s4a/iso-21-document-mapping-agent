# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 5.18 Access rights

## 1. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This is the most directly relevant document as it establishes the fundamental access management framework required by control 5.18. The policy defines access management principles including unique user identifiers, authorization processes, role-based access control, privileged access management, and least privilege principle. It explicitly requires a process for application and approval of access privileges, and mandates that access rights be removed prior to employee separation, directly addressing the control's requirements for provisioning, review, modification and removal of access rights.

## 2. Onboarding Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104063

This procedure is highly relevant as it details the process of granting initial access rights to new employees, including LDAP account creation, group assignments, system access provisioning, and authentication setup. It directly supports the formal authorization of access requests and access control rule implementation mentioned in Control 5.18. The procedure ensures that access rights are provisioned based on business roles and job responsibilities, with proper authorization from management.

## 3. Offboarding Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104057

This procedure covers the systematic revocation of access rights when personnel leave the organization, including account deactivation, access removal, and transfer of responsibilities. It ensures that access control rules are maintained throughout the employee lifecycle and prevents unauthorized access. The procedure addresses the control requirement for timely removal of access rights when employees no longer need access, particularly when they leave the organization.

## 4. Employee Offboarding
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4AIH/pages/149520666

This detailed technical procedure provides comprehensive steps for removing access across all systems (LDAP, Google, Jira, AWS, VPN, licenses, alarm codes). It supports enforcement of access control rules and ensures that physical and logical access is properly terminated to prevent unauthorized access. The procedure ensures access rights are removed on the first business day after contract termination, directly supporting the control's requirement for timely access revocation.

## 5. Rules of Personal Data Protection
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170102152

This document is relevant because it establishes the access management procedures for work commencement, suspension and termination, which aligns with control 5.18's requirements for provisioning and revocation of access rights. It specifies that individual user identifiers are granted at the moment cooperation begins, accounts are managed by IT Administrators, and authorizations are granted based on business roles. The document ensures that the access rights lifecycle is properly managed from provisioning through revocation.
