# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 5.2 Information security roles and responsibilities

## 1. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This is the most directly relevant document as it explicitly states that "Smart4Aviation Group assigns security-related responsibilities to individuals and groups" and references "Schedule 1. Security Responsibilities" which defines security-related responsibilities arising from job roles. The document establishes the overall security governance framework, defines asset ownership (information and IT assets have owners), specifies access management responsibilities, and addresses separation of duties - all core elements required by ISO 27001 control 5.2 for defining and allocating information security roles and responsibilities.

## 2. Risk Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170100789

This policy directly addresses the control requirement for information security risk management activities and acceptance of residual risks (guidance point c). It explicitly defines responsibilities for Risk Owners, CEO, Executives, Directors, and all employees in managing risks within their areas of responsibility. The document establishes who is accountable for risk optimization, risk treatment decisions, and risk register management, which are critical components of information security role definitions.

## 3. Rules of Personal Data Protection
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170102152

This document defines access management responsibilities and authorization levels, which directly supports the control requirement for defining authorization levels and documenting responsibilities. It specifies that IT Administrators manage accounts and authorizations are granted based on business roles at supervisor's request, establishing clear lines of responsibility for access control. The document also defines user responsibilities for protecting information assets, aligning with guidance point (a) for protection of information and associated assets.

## 4. Internal Auditing Policy for Security
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/2086699019

This policy defines process owner responsibilities for facilitating audits and deploying mitigations within their areas, supporting the control's requirement that individuals with allocated security responsibilities remain accountable and determine that delegated tasks are correctly performed. It establishes auditor selection criteria ensuring competence, which aligns with the control guidance that individuals taking on security roles should be competent in required knowledge and skills.

## 5. Security Incident Reporting Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104051

This procedure defines responsibilities for security incident reporting and management, addressing the control requirement for carrying out specific information security processes (guidance point b). It establishes clear roles for Security Team, IT Administrators, Implementation Consultants, and all personnel in reporting and responding to security incidents, demonstrating how security responsibilities are allocated and communicated throughout the organization.
