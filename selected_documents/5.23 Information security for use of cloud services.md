**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170099594

This is the most directly relevant document as it establishes comprehensive security requirements for supplier relationships, which includes cloud service providers. The policy covers all relevant information security requirements including breach notification, data security, disaster recovery, incident response, personal data protection, right to audit, and supply chain security. It establishes processes for evaluating cloud services, conducting security assessments, and negotiating security requirements in contracts. The document addresses cloud services as part of supplier relationships and ensures cloud service providers meet the same security standards as other suppliers, directly supporting control 5.23 requirements.

## 2. Company Managed Service Agreements
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170108066

This document is highly relevant as it establishes the framework for Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with service providers, including cloud service providers. The document addresses how service agreements formalize service expectations, define service level targets, and specify responsibilities. It covers monitoring mechanisms and service level management, which are essential for cloud services. The document supports control 5.23 requirements for defining cloud service selection criteria, roles and responsibilities, and how to monitor, review and evaluate ongoing use of cloud services to manage information security risks.

## 3. Security Incident Reporting Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104051

This procedure is relevant because control 5.23 requires procedures for handling information security incidents that occur in relation to the use of cloud services. The document establishes the incident reporting framework, notification procedures, and incident management processes that apply to all security incidents, including those related to cloud services. It ensures that incidents involving cloud services are properly reported, tracked, and managed, supporting the control requirement for incident management procedures specific to cloud service usage.

## 4. Personal Data Protection Breach Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170099350

This document is relevant because control 5.23 requires addressing data protection requirements for cloud services, including processing and storing sensitive information in approved locations and compliance with data protection laws. The procedure establishes GDPR compliance requirements, breach notification procedures, and data protection measures that are critical when using cloud services. It ensures that personal data protection requirements are properly addressed in cloud service agreements and that cloud service providers understand their data protection obligations, including restrictions on processing data outside the EEA.

## 5. Server management procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170107313

This procedure is relevant because control 5.23 requires defining which information security controls are managed by the cloud service provider and which are managed by the organization. The document establishes procedures for managing server infrastructure, including cloud-based virtual machines and infrastructure resources. It addresses resource allocation, configuration management, and infrastructure controls, which helps clarify the division of responsibilities between the organization and cloud service providers. This supports the control requirement for defining roles and responsibilities related to the use and management of cloud services.

## 6. Daily Agreed Procedures document
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CSACAMIG/pages/338363169

This document is relevant because control 5.23 requires establishing procedures for monitoring, reviewing and evaluating ongoing use of cloud services, including service level objectives and availability requirements. This document provides a concrete example of service level agreements with detailed availability targets, incident management procedures, response times, and monitoring mechanisms. It demonstrates how cloud service agreements should address service availability, incident response, and service level monitoring, supporting the control requirement for obtaining assurance on information security controls implemented by cloud service providers and managing ongoing cloud service usage.
