# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 5.7 Threat intelligence

## 1. Vulnerability Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/214794244

This policy is directly relevant to threat intelligence as it establishes processes for identifying and evaluating vulnerabilities against known vulnerability databases, which are key sources of threat intelligence. The document requires assessment of exploitation probability based on available threat information, demonstrating how threat intelligence feeds into vulnerability management decisions and treatment strategies.

## 2. Security Incident Reporting Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104051

This procedure is highly relevant because it establishes the Security Incident Management Plan and CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team) framework. Threat intelligence is essential for incident detection, analysis, and response - the CSIRT team uses threat intelligence to understand attack patterns, methodologies, and indicators of compromise when analyzing security incidents.

## 3. Network General Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104105

This policy is critical for threat intelligence implementation as it mandates continuous monitoring, IPS/IDS systems, and network security scanning activities. The document requires monitoring solutions that collect information from multiple sources including audit logs, IPS/IDS output, and security scanning - all of which produce threat intelligence data that needs to be analyzed and acted upon.

## 4. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This umbrella policy is relevant because it establishes the overall security framework and explicitly mentions reviewing security controls in response to changes in the threat landscape. The policy requires regular vulnerability testing, penetration testing, and reviewing common attacking patterns - all activities that depend on threat intelligence to identify current threats, attacker methodologies, and attack techniques.

## 5. Risk Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170100789

This policy is relevant because ISO 27001 control 5.7 specifically requires that threat intelligence be integrated into information security risk management processes. The document establishes risk identification, analysis, and response processes where threat intelligence provides critical input for understanding emerging risks, threat probability, and impact assessment.
