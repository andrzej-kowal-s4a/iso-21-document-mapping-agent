## 1. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This is the most directly relevant document as it serves as the umbrella policy that mandates all Smart4Aviation personnel to follow information security policies and procedures. The policy explicitly states that "All Smart4Aviation personnel is responsible for following this policy" and defines security-related responsibilities assigned to individuals and groups. The Personnel Security section requires security awareness training upon starting work and annual refreshers, directly addressing the control's requirement for management to ensure personnel are briefed on their security roles and responsibilities and achieve appropriate security awareness levels.

## 2. Onboarding Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104063

This procedure is highly relevant as it ensures personnel are properly briefed on their information security roles and responsibilities prior to being granted access. The procedure mandates employee identity verification on the first day, assignment of security awareness training tickets ("2025 Security Awareness Training"), and requires new employees to read procedures, policies, and GDPR documentation through BambooHR. The Manager's role includes assigning an Onboarding Buddy and explaining expectations, ensuring personnel receive guidelines stating information security expectations of their role within the organization.

## 3. SYGNALISTA: Procedura zgłoszeń wewnętrznych/WHISTLEBLOWER: Internal Reporting Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/1205665906

This document directly addresses the control requirement for providing a confidential channel for reporting violations of information security policy, topic-specific policies or procedures ("whistleblowing"). The procedure establishes an internal reporting mechanism via email (sygnalista@smart4aviation.aero) that allows for anonymous reporting and ensures confidentiality of the reporter's identity. It protects whistleblowers from retaliatory actions and provides a formal process for management to address security policy violations, demonstrating management's commitment to ensuring personnel can report security concerns safely.

## 4. Security Incident Reporting Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104051

This procedure supports the management responsibility control by establishing a mandatory reporting mechanism for all personnel to report security incidents. It explicitly states that "All personnel of Smart4Aviation Group" must report security incidents and that "Responsibility for the execution of this procedure is on any person who observes a security incident." The procedure ensures personnel are aware of their responsibility to report security violations and provides clear guidance on how to do so, supporting management's role in mandating compliance with information security policies and procedures.

## 5. Personnel Vetting Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104805

This policy is relevant because it establishes management's responsibility to ensure personnel are properly briefed on security requirements before being granted access. The policy mandates that identity verification must be performed prior to issuing permissions to work with information above Disclosable sensitivity level, ensuring personnel are properly briefed on their security roles and responsibilities prior to access. It also defines designated management personnel (Director Back Office and HR team) responsible for performing identity verification, demonstrating management's active role in personnel security processes.

## 6. Risk Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170100789

This policy demonstrates management's responsibilities in information security governance and resource allocation. It explicitly defines management responsibilities: CEO is responsible for ensuring risk management integration, Executives are responsible for identifying risks and allocating sufficient resources, and Directors are responsible for managing the Risk Management Program and coordinating risk management education and training. This aligns with the control requirement that management should ensure personnel are provided with adequate resources and project planning time for implementing security-related processes and controls.
