## 1. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This is the most directly relevant document as it establishes the overall framework for information security responsibilities across Smart4Aviation Group. The policy explicitly assigns security-related responsibilities to individuals and groups, defines management's role in security, and establishes that all personnel are responsible for following security policies. It covers personnel security requirements including security awareness training, workforce suitability determinations, and compliance with information security policies, which directly aligns with ISO 27001 control 5.4 requirements for management to ensure personnel apply information security in accordance with established policies.

## 2. Onboarding Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104063

This procedure is highly relevant as it ensures that personnel are properly briefed on their information security roles and responsibilities prior to being granted access to the organization's information and assets. The procedure includes identity verification on the first day, assignment of mandatory HR-related documents including security policies via BambooHR, and ensures that new employees receive security awareness training. It covers all types of personnel (full-time, part-time, contractors, B2B) which aligns with the ISO control requirement for management to ensure all personnel are aware of their information security responsibilities.

## 3. Personnel Vetting Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104805

This policy is relevant because it establishes the framework for ensuring personnel have appropriate information security skills and qualifications through screening processes. The policy covers background verification checks, identity verification, and suitability determinations for positions requiring access to high confidentiality information. It ensures that management fulfills its responsibility to verify that personnel are capable of performing their duties without undue risk, which supports the ISO control requirement for management to ensure personnel achieve appropriate levels of awareness and skills relevant to their roles.

## 4. Training Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106790

This procedure is relevant because ISO 27001 control 5.4 requires management to ensure personnel continue to have appropriate information security skills and qualifications through ongoing professional education. This procedure establishes the process for requesting, approving, and managing training requests for all team members, ensuring that management provides resources for ongoing professional development. It covers both internal and external training, which supports the control requirement for continuous skill development and awareness relevant to information security roles.

## 5. SYGNALISTA: Procedura zgłoszeń wewnętrznych/WHISTLEBLOWER: Internal Reporting Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/1205665906

This procedure is directly relevant as ISO 27001 control 5.4 specifically requires management to provide personnel with a confidential channel for reporting violations of information security policy, topic-specific policies or procedures ("whistleblowing"). This procedure establishes an internal reporting mechanism that allows for anonymous reporting and ensures protection of whistleblowers from retaliatory actions. It provides a confidential channel (sygnalista@smart4aviation.aero) for reporting legal violations including those related to information security, network and information systems security, and privacy and personal data protection, which directly supports this control requirement.
