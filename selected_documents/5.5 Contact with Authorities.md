**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106479

This is the most directly relevant document as it establishes Smart4Aviation Group's commitment to ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including those in the Netherlands, Poland, and the European Union. The policy explicitly addresses the need to understand and comply with regulatory obligations, and establishes monitoring responsibilities for different departments (HR, Sales) to track applicable laws and regulations. It ensures that the organization maintains awareness of current and upcoming regulatory expectations, which directly aligns with ISO 27001 control 5.5 requirements for establishing and maintaining contact with relevant legal, regulatory and supervisory authorities to facilitate understanding of their expectations.

## 2. Security Incident Reporting Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104051

This procedure is highly relevant because ISO 27001 control 5.5 requires organizations to specify when and by whom authorities should be contacted and how identified information security incidents should be reported in a timely manner. This procedure establishes the framework for reporting security incidents, which may require notification to regulatory bodies, law enforcement, or supervisory authorities depending on the nature of the incident. It ensures that security incidents are properly reported and managed, which supports the control requirement for timely incident reporting to authorities.

## 3. Personal Data Protection Policy (Polityka Bezpieczeństwa Danych Osobowych)
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170101280

This policy is relevant because it addresses compliance with GDPR and establishes contact points with data protection supervisory authorities. The policy defines the Data Protection Officer role and establishes procedures for reporting personal data breaches to supervisory authorities as required by GDPR. It ensures that the organization maintains appropriate contact with data protection authorities and understands their requirements, which supports ISO 27001 control 5.5 requirements for maintaining contact with regulatory bodies and understanding current and upcoming expectations of authorities, particularly in the context of privacy and data protection regulations.

## 4. SYGNALISTA: Procedura zgłoszeń wewnętrznych/WHISTLEBLOWER: Internal Reporting Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/1205665906

This procedure is relevant because it establishes mechanisms for external reporting to public or central authorities when internal reporting is not appropriate or sufficient. The procedure defines "external report" as communication of information about legal violations to public or central authorities, and provides guidance on when and how such external reporting should occur. It ensures that personnel understand how to contact relevant authorities when necessary, which supports ISO 27001 control 5.5 requirements for establishing contact with authorities and understanding when and how to report to them, particularly in cases involving legal violations or regulatory non-compliance.
