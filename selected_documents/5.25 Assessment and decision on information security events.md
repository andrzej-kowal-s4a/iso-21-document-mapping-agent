# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 5.25 Assessment and decision on information security events

## 1. Security Incident Reporting Procedure / Procedura zgłaszania incydentów związanych z bezpieczeństwem
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104051

This procedure is directly relevant as it establishes the assessment and decision-making process for information security events. It specifies that where there is uncertainty as to whether a particular event is regarded as a security incident, the event should still be reported and will later be analyzed by the response team (S4A CSIRT) and closed if invalid. The procedure defines what constitutes a security incident and establishes the point of contact (Security Team) responsible for coordinating and responding to incidents, which aligns with the control's requirement for personnel to perform assessment and make decisions on information security events.

## 2. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This policy is relevant because it establishes the framework for security incident management and defines that any observed or suspected information security incidents shall be reported using the relevant information security incident reporting process. The policy establishes the overall security management system and defines security incident management responsibilities, which provides the foundation for the categorization and prioritization scheme required by this control. It ensures that security events are properly identified and assessed within the organization's security framework.

## 3. Personal Data Protection Breach Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170099350

This procedure is relevant because it establishes assessment criteria for determining if a personal data breach constitutes a security incident requiring notification. It provides examples of different types of breaches (confidentiality, integrity, availability) and establishes procedures for detection and assessment of breaches to determine if they pose a serious risk. The procedure demonstrates how events are assessed and categorized, and requires that breaches be documented in SECURITY ticket project in Jira, ensuring that assessment results are recorded in detail for future reference and verification as required by the control.
