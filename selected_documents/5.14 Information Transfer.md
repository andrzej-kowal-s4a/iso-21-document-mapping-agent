# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 5.14 Information Transfer

## 1. Encryption and Cryptography Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170105815

This policy is highly relevant as it establishes requirements for protecting information in transit, which is a core aspect of ISO 27001 control 5.14. The policy mandates encryption for data transmitted outside secure S4A systems, specifies approved encryption methods including VPN connections and encrypted transmission protocols, and requires encryption of customer data in transit to protect integrity and prevent eavesdropping. It directly addresses the control's requirement for cryptographic techniques to protect transferred information.

## 2. Information Technology Acceptable Use Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106001

This policy is relevant as it establishes rules for electronic communication facilities including email, instant messaging, and other communication channels. It includes provisions for proper use of corporate email, prohibits forwarding corporate correspondence to private emails, addresses phishing awareness, and establishes guidelines for message forwarding and content alteration. These rules support the control's requirements for electronic transfer procedures, including protection against sending messages to wrong addresses and ensuring appropriate use of communication facilities.

## 3. Rules of Personal Data Protection
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170102152

This document is highly relevant as it establishes specific rules for email and communicator use, including prohibitions on sending personal data through non-private communicators like Skype, requirements for reporting suspicious emails, and rules for data transfer. It explicitly prohibits use of portable data carriers (pendrives) and mandates data transfer through corporate applications (Google Drive, version control systems, corporate FTP, Jira). The document also addresses secure transport of portable devices containing data, which relates to physical storage media transfer requirements.

## 4. General Information Media Disposal Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104943

This policy is relevant as it addresses the proper handling and disposal of physical storage media (hard drives, diskettes, CDs, hard copies, print-outs) that have been used to process, store, and/or transmit classified and sensitive data. It ensures that media is not released from Smart4Aviation's control until properly sanitized, which relates to the control's requirements for physical storage media transfer procedures, including responsibilities for controlling transmission, dispatch and receipt, and ensuring proper handling of physical media.

## 5. OpenVPN Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170107980

This policy is relevant as it establishes the exclusive use of OpenVPN for secure remote access to internal networks, which is a critical component of secure electronic information transfer. It specifies authentication requirements based on LDAP and establishes that access from external locations must use this secure channel. This supports the control's requirements for stronger levels of authentication when transferring information via publicly accessible networks and ensuring secure electronic transfer facilities.
