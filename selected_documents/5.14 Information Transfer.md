# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 5.14 Information Transfer

## 1. Rules of Personal Data Protection
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170102152

This document is the most directly relevant as it comprehensively covers information transfer rules and procedures required by control 5.14. It establishes specific rules for email and communicator use, including prohibitions on forwarding corporate correspondence to private emails and sending personal data through non-private communicators like Skype. The document also addresses physical storage media transfer by requiring secure transport of portable devices containing personal data, recommending encryption for laptop hard drives, and prohibiting portable data carriers (pendrives) while mandating use of corporate applications (Google Drive, version control systems, corporate FTP, Jira) for data transfer. These provisions directly align with the control's requirements for electronic transfer, physical storage media transfer, and protection of information in transit.

## 2. Encryption and Cryptography Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170105815

This policy is highly relevant as it establishes mandatory encryption requirements for data in transit, which is a critical control specified in ISO 27001 control 5.14. The policy requires that when S4A information is transmitted outside secure S4A systems, it shall be encrypted in transit using methods such as S4A VPN connections, encrypted portable hard disks, encrypted transmission protocols, and approved ciphers. The policy also mandates that customer data under S4A custody shall be encrypted to protect integrity and prevent eavesdropping in transit. These encryption requirements directly support the control's requirement for cryptographic techniques to protect transferred information from interception and unauthorized access.

## 3. Information Technology Acceptable Use Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106001

This policy is relevant because it establishes communication rules and procedures that support the information transfer control requirements. It requires users to comply with rules of email and instant messaging use as outlined in Rules of Personal Data Protection, prohibits SPAM transmission, requires vigilance against phishing emails, and establishes rules for forwarding messages including not altering original content unless authorized. The policy also mandates that corporate email addresses and services be used strictly for business purposes, prohibiting personal use. These communication rules align with the control's requirements for acceptable use of information transfer facilities and protection against malware transmitted through electronic communications.

## 4. Supplier Security Risk Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170099594

This policy is highly relevant as ISO 27001 control 5.14 specifically requires transfer agreements when information is transferred between the organization and third parties. The policy establishes security requirements for suppliers including confidentiality obligations, data security measures, personal data protection requirements, and remote access security procedures. It mandates that suppliers ensure confidential information is treated as strictly confidential and not disclosed to third parties without prior written consent, and requires suppliers to implement technical and organizational security measures to protect customer data from unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or destruction. The policy also covers contractual security clauses and data processing agreements (DPA) which directly support the control's requirement for transfer agreements with external parties.

## 5. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This policy is relevant as it provides the overarching security framework that supports information transfer controls. It establishes information classification and handling requirements, requiring that information be handled securely in accordance with its confidentiality level, which directly supports the control's requirement that transfer rules reflect the classification of information involved. The policy also establishes access management principles, customer data security requirements, and personal data security requirements that ensure information transferred is appropriately protected based on its sensitivity. Additionally, it requires that network connections between systems be identified, documented and sufficiently protected, which supports secure information transfer infrastructure.
