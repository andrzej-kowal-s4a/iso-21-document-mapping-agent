# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 5.14 Information Transfer

## 1. Rules of Personal Data Protection
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170102152

This procedure is directly relevant as it establishes comprehensive rules for information transfer including email and communicator use, prohibiting sending personal data through insecure channels like Skype or non-private communicators. The document specifies that data transfer must be ensured through corporate applications (Google Drive, version control systems, corporate FTP, Jira) and prohibits use of portable data carriers, directly addressing the ISO control requirements for rules and procedures to protect information in transit.

## 2. Encryption and Cryptography Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170105815

This policy is highly relevant because it establishes mandatory encryption requirements for data in transit, requiring that when S4A information is transmitted outside secure S4A systems, it shall be encrypted in transit. The policy specifies approved methods including VPN connections, encrypted portable hard disks, and encrypted transmission protocols, which directly addresses the ISO control requirement for controls designed to protect transferred information from interception and unauthorized access, including use of cryptographic techniques.

## 3. Network General Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104105

This policy is critical for information transfer as it establishes VPN requirements mandating that data transfer between trusted and untrusted networks must use encryption to prevent compromise, and includes integrity checking mechanisms. The policy requires VPN gateways to mutually authenticate with devices before allowing access and maintains audit logs for all actions, addressing the ISO control requirements for traceability, non-repudiation, and protection of information transferred via electronic means.

## 4. Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106633

This policy is relevant because it establishes secure remote access requirements for information transfer, mandating that BYOD devices must use VPNs with cryptography to protect confidentiality and integrity of data in transit. The policy prohibits storing Secret or Restricted data on BYOD devices and requires secure remote data access methods, addressing the ISO control requirements for stronger levels of authentication when transferring information via publicly accessible networks and restrictions on information transfer facilities.

## 5. Supplier Security Risk Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170099594

This policy is relevant because it establishes security requirements for transfer agreements with third parties, including requirements for data security, confidentiality, and personal data protection when information is transferred to suppliers. The policy requires suppliers to implement technical and organizational security measures to protect business data from unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or destruction during transfer, which addresses the ISO control requirement for transfer agreements between the organization and third parties to protect information in all forms in transit.

## 6. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This umbrella policy is relevant because it establishes the overall framework for information security including requirements for secure network connections, remote access controls, and protection of information in transit. The policy requires that any information must be handled securely in accordance with its confidentiality level and establishes requirements for network segmentation and firewall deployment, providing the foundation for information transfer security controls required by the ISO control.
