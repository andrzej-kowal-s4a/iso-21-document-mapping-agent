## 1. Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106633

This policy is highly relevant as it explicitly addresses forensic evidence collection procedures. It requires team members to cooperate and provide assistance during security incidents, including providing forensic data such as logs or other evidence contained in computers, network devices, or other relevant stores. The policy also allows Smart4Aviation to require installation of forensic software to help collect evidence, and establishes procedures for handling forensic data while respecting privacy. This directly addresses the control requirement for procedures to identify, collect, and acquire evidence related to information security events.

## 2. Security Incident Reporting Procedure / Procedura zgłaszania incydentów związanych z bezpieczeństwem
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104051

This procedure is relevant because it establishes the framework for reporting security incidents, which is the initial step that triggers evidence collection activities. The procedure requires incidents to be reported and documented in Jira tickets (SECURITY queue), creating a record of incidents that serves as evidence. The procedure is part of the overall Security Incident Management Plan and ensures that incidents are formally documented, which is essential for preserving evidence related to information security events for disciplinary and legal purposes.

## 3. Whistleblower Protection Policy / Polityka Ochrony Sygnalistów
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/1205665906

This policy is relevant because it addresses evidence collection in the context of legal and disciplinary actions. The policy mentions that follow-up actions include investigative procedures, filing charges, disciplinary proceedings, and submitting reports of reasonable suspicion of crime "if evidence has been gathered" or "if circumstantial evidence has been collected." The policy establishes procedures for investigations that require evidence collection and documentation, addressing the control's purpose of ensuring evidence management for disciplinary and legal actions. The policy also requires confidentiality and proper handling of information obtained during investigations.

## 4. Internal Auditing Policy for Security
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/2086699019

This policy is relevant because it establishes requirements for evidence gathering, documentation, and retention as part of audit activities. The policy requires that audits follow a structured approach including "evidence gathering" and that there shall be "sufficient evidence" including links to documents, code, software artifacts, tickets, logs, and other forms of documented information. All audit plans, reports, and evidence must be maintained as part of ISMS documentation. This addresses the control requirement for procedures to preserve evidence and ensure records are complete and properly maintained, which is essential for demonstrating that evidence has not been tampered with.

## 5. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This policy is relevant because it establishes logging and audit requirements that support evidence collection. The policy requires that access to IT systems be logged and that "any Smart4Aviation Group personnel access to customer production data shall be logged." It also requires implementation of monitoring, logging, and auditing as compensatory security controls. These logging requirements create audit trails that serve as evidence of system operations and user activities, addressing the control requirement (c) to show that information systems were operating correctly at the time evidence was recorded. The policy also requires separation of duties and monitoring activities, which support the integrity of evidence collection processes.
