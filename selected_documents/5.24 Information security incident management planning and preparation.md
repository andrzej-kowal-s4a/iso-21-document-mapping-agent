# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 5.24 Information security incident management planning and preparation

## 1. Security Incident Reporting Procedure / Procedura zgłaszania incydentów związanych z bezpieczeństwem
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104051

This procedure is directly relevant as it establishes the common method for reporting information security events including the point of contact (Security Team). It defines roles and responsibilities for incident reporting, specifies that incidents are managed through Jira tickets in the SECURITY queue, and establishes that this procedure is part of the overall Security Incident Management Plan. The procedure covers reporting actions, incident forms (Jira tickets), and provides guidance on what constitutes a security incident, directly supporting the control's requirements for establishing incident management processes and communication procedures.

## 2. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This policy is highly relevant as it establishes the Security Incident Management framework for the organization. It explicitly states that Smart4Aviation Group has a Security Incident Management Plan established to effectively respond to security incidents, and that any observed or suspected information security incidents shall be reported using the relevant information security incident reporting process. The policy establishes the overall security management system and continuous improvement commitment, which supports the planning and preparation aspects of incident management required by this control.

## 3. Major Incidents
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SUP/pages/160433356

This procedure is relevant because it establishes incident management processes including administration, documentation, detection, triage, prioritization, analysis, and coordination with interested parties. It defines roles and responsibilities (Support Manager, Product Owner, management), establishes escalation procedures, and includes requirements for Root Cause Analysis. The procedure covers incident response activities, logging requirements, and coordination with internal parties, which directly supports the control's requirements for establishing incident management procedures and roles.

## 4. Communication procedure in case of Major Incident
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170102638

This procedure is relevant as it establishes communication procedures for incidents, which is a key requirement of control 5.24. It defines the process flow for communicating with customers and internal stakeholders during incidents, including notification procedures, status updates, and coordination activities. The procedure ensures that communication to internal and external interested parties follows defined processes, supporting the control's requirement for establishing and communicating incident management processes and procedures.

## 5. Personal Data Protection Breach Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170099350

This procedure is relevant because it is explicitly linked to the Security Incident Management Plan and provides specific procedures for handling personal data breaches, which are a subset of security incidents. It covers breach detection, assessment, reporting procedures (including external notification requirements to supervisory authorities), breach logging/register maintenance, and establishes roles and responsibilities including the Data Protection Officer. The procedure demonstrates how incident management procedures are developed for specific scenarios, supporting the control's requirement for creating incident management plans considering different scenarios.
