## 1. Supplier Security Risk Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170099594

This is the most directly relevant document as it establishes the framework for monitoring and reviewing supplier security practices. The policy includes a dedicated section on "Periodic audits of high-risk purchase Suppliers - Supplier Security Self-Assessment" which requires regular monitoring and evaluation of supplier information security management programs. It mandates that changes in supplier security practices be regularly reviewed and managed, and establishes procedures for conducting supplier self-assessments and comparing them with previous assessments or RFI responses. This directly supports control 5.22 requirements for monitoring, review, and change management of supplier services.

## 2. Company Managed Service Agreements
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170108066

This document is highly relevant as it establishes Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and Operational Level Agreements (OLAs) that define service performance levels and monitoring mechanisms. The document addresses how SLAs formalize service expectations and provide a basis for monitoring service delivery. It includes recommendations for monitoring tools and establishes the framework for measuring service performance against agreed targets, which directly supports control 5.22 requirements for monitoring service performance levels to verify compliance with agreements.

## 3. Ownership of reported issues/problems - support process owner
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SUP/pages/160435576

This procedure is relevant because control 5.22 requires monitoring service performance, reviewing service reports, and managing service delivery issues. This document establishes ownership and responsibility for monitoring and resolving customer-reported issues, including regular updates, escalation procedures, and tracking mechanisms. It ensures systematic review of service delivery problems and supports the control requirement for reviewing service reports and managing information security events or incidents related to supplier services.

## 4. Communication procedure in case of Major Incident
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170102638

This procedure is relevant because control 5.22 requires responding to and managing identified information security events or incidents, and providing information about incidents as required by agreements. The document establishes procedures for incident notification, status updates, customer communication, and problem management activities including root cause analysis. It ensures proper incident management and communication processes are in place, supporting the control requirement for managing information security incidents and problems properly.

## 5. Security Incident Reporting Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104051

This procedure is relevant because control 5.22 requires reviewing information about information security incidents and managing them properly. The document establishes the incident reporting framework, notification procedures, and incident management processes. It ensures that security incidents are properly reported, tracked, and managed, which supports the control requirement for reviewing supplier audit trails and records of information security events, operational problems, failures, and disruptions related to the service delivered.

## 6. Daily Agreed Procedures document
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CSACAMIG/pages/338363169

This document is relevant because control 5.22 requires monitoring service performance levels, reviewing service reports, and ensuring suppliers maintain adequate information security levels. This document establishes detailed SLA parameters, incident severity levels, response times, resolution times, availability targets, and incident management procedures for supplier services. It provides a concrete example of how supplier service delivery is monitored and reviewed, including escalation procedures and service level monitoring mechanisms that directly support the control requirements.
