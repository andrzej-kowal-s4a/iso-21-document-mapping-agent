# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 5.8 Information security in project management

## 1. Change Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104688

This comprehensive policy establishes the framework for integrating security into project management by requiring security risk assessment for all changes throughout the project lifecycle. It covers multiple change types (standard, normal, emergency), defines change authorities, and ensures that security considerations are addressed in planning, evaluation, review, approval, and implementation phases. The policy directly supports Control 5.8 by requiring that information security risks are assessed and treated as part of project risks throughout the project life cycle.

## 2. Procedure: Baseline Management
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104985

This procedure directly addresses information security integration in project planning by establishing a formal baseline management process for product versions. It includes structured governance through Change Review Board (CRB) approval, ensures security considerations are embedded in the planning phase, and defines clear approval criteria and responsibilities for projects throughout their lifecycle. The procedure ensures that information security requirements are addressed in the early stages of projects as required by Control 5.8.

## 3. Procedure: Change to Baseline Management
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106091

This procedure complements baseline management by controlling subsequent changes to project plans through a formal Change Review Board process. It ensures that information security impacts are assessed when project scope changes, requires impact assessment preparation covering products, projects, resources, and finances, and establishes a governance framework with defined roles and approval authorities for managing project changes throughout the project lifecycle.

## 4. Procedure - Service transition to prod
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SUP/pages/160433255

This detailed procedure addresses information security integration throughout project delivery and transition phases. It includes comprehensive Service Acceptance Criteria covering security requirements verification, monitoring setup, disaster recovery testing, vulnerability management, access controls, and knowledge transfer - ensuring security risks are treated throughout the entire project life cycle. The procedure ensures progress on information security risk treatment is reviewed and effectiveness is evaluated and tested as required by Control 5.8.

## 5. Risk Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170100789

This policy provides the foundational framework for identifying, analyzing, and managing risks at both operational and strategic levels, including project-related risks. It establishes the methodology for integrating risk management into planning and decision-making processes, defines risk owners and responsibilities, and ensures risks are monitored and controlled throughout projects. The policy directly supports Control 5.8's requirement for information security risks to be assessed and treated as part of project risks.

## 6. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This umbrella policy establishes the overarching security framework that must be integrated into all projects. It defines mandatory security requirements for systems development, requires security risk assessments for projects and new technologies, establishes secure SDLC requirements, and sets security responsibilities that apply throughout project management activities. The policy ensures that information security requirements are derived from information security policy and topic-specific policies as required by Control 5.8.
