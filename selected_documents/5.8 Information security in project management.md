# Selected Documents for ISO 27001 Control 5.8 Information security in project management

## 1. Risk Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170100789

This policy is directly relevant as it establishes Activity Risk Management, which is the process of identifying, analyzing and managing risks that integrates risk into planning and decision making processes at the operational level (project level). The policy defines Risk Owners who have responsibility to optimize risk for projects/activities, and establishes the methodology for integrating risk into project planning, which aligns with the ISO control requirement for assessing and treating information security risks as part of project risks throughout the project life cycle.

## 2. Information Security Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104722

This policy is highly relevant as it explicitly states that Smart4Aviation Group carries out security risk assessments for projects, and requires that systems be developed in accordance with a secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) that considers security throughout lifecycle phases. The policy mandates formal change control policies and procedures for all systems, including changes that may affect production environments, which directly supports the control's requirement for addressing information security risks throughout the project life cycle and reviewing progress on risk treatment.

## 3. Change Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170104688

This policy is relevant because it establishes formal change management processes that cover the entire service lifecycle, including changes to architecture, processes, tools, and documentation. The policy requires evaluation of changes including risk determination based on priority level and nature of proposed changes, and mandates review and approval processes. This directly supports the ISO control requirement for considering information security risks associated with project execution and treating them throughout the project life cycle.

## 4. Product Development and Support Security Credentials Procedure
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170106199

This procedure is relevant as it establishes "Security by Design" principles requiring that solutions be architected, designed, implemented or maintained with security features in mind at every software lifecycle phase. It defines Project Manager responsibilities and addresses security considerations in Customer Projects, including requirements for secure deployment, documentation of security features, and proper handling of security credentials throughout project execution, which aligns with the control's requirement for addressing information security requirements in early project stages.

## 5. Supplier Security Risk Management Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170099594

This policy is relevant because it addresses security risk assessment for purchases and projects involving suppliers, requiring evaluation of security-related risks tied to purchases and establishing security requirements based on purchase categories. The policy applies to project leaders responsible for executing contracts with suppliers and requires assessment of security posture and application of appropriate security requirements, which supports the ISO control requirement for determining information security requirements for products or services to be delivered by projects, including those involving third parties.

## 6. Information Classification Policy
**Confluence URL:** https://smart4aviation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S4A/pages/170101881

This policy is relevant as it establishes the framework for classifying information based on confidentiality, integrity and availability requirements, which directly supports the ISO control requirement for determining what information is involved in projects and what are the corresponding information security needs (classification). The policy provides guidance on protection needs of information in terms of confidentiality, integrity and availability, which are key considerations when determining information security requirements for projects as specified in the control guidance.
