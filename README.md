# ISO-21 Document Mapping Matching Agent

The project include:
- keywords generation for documents
- document selection for ISO 27001 controls

## Keywords Generation

- Document keyword generation using AI agents
- Batch processing of multiple documents
- JSON-based keyword storage

## Document Selection for ISO 27001 Controls

### Usage of document selectio with AWS Bedrock agent

```bash
python execute_control.py 5.7
python execute_control.py 8.15
python execute_control.py 5.1
```

## Project Structure

- `documents/` - Source documents to process
- `documents_keywords/` - Generated keyword JSON files
- `controls/` - ISO control documents
- `selected_documents/` - Selected documents for processing manually by the Cursor commands manualy (to compare to automatically generated by the agent)
- `selected_documents_agent/` - Selected documents for processing by the agent (bedrock agent) with app/selector/execute_control.py script



# Notes and Lessons Learned
- Cursor generated documents may be little better (agent has been using first search for keywords in the documents and then load selected documents content)
- The Agent has been loading selected documents (however selection may may not be perfect - Selection based on the name of the document)
- Low cost models like Nova 2 Omni has generated less results (3 which was a minimum for the control). 
- Cloude 4.5 has generated more results (in most cases 8 documents which was a maximum for the control). Context size optimisation ???
